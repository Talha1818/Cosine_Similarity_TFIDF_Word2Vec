# Cosine_Similarity_TFIDF_Word2Vec

## TF-IDF
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a widely used statistical method in natural language processing and information retrieval. It measures how important a term is within a document relative to a collection of documents (i.e., relative to a corpus).

## Word2Vec
The Word2Vec model is used to extract the notion of relatedness across words or products such as semantic relatedness, synonym detection, concept categorization, selectional preferences, and analogy. A Word2Vec model learns meaningful relations and encodes the relatedness into vector similarity.
