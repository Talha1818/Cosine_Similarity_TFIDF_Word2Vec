31/10/2017 00:00,2017,10,31,Juan Williams,Juan Williams: Trump's war on media is truly dangerous,"close Video President Trump complains about portrayal in the press Trump says journalists make him 'more uncivil' than he actually is; reaction from Howard Kurtz, Fox News media analyst and host of 'MediaBuzz.' Editor&aposs note: This first appeared in  The Hill . Okay, you are covering the White House. What do you do when a retired four-star general who is now White House Chief of Staff tells lies in an on-the-record briefing? You stick to the facts, and let readers and viewers realize the alarming dereliction of public trust from a high government official. Then comes a response from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. ""If you want to go after General [John] Kelly that&aposs up to you, but I think that if you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that&aposs something highly inappropriate,"" Sanders said. Letâ€™s review this effort to normalize lying by a White House official. In a democracy â€” government by the people and for the people â€” it is now â€œhighly inappropriateâ€ to tell the truth about a Chief of Staff who tells confirmed falsehoods? Trumpâ€™s appetite for shutting down the free press is a reminder of his open admiration for strong men dictators like Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin, Turkeyâ€™s Recep Erdogan and the Philippinesâ€™ Rodrigo Duterte.  That appears to be President Trumpâ€™s opinion. He said in the Oval Office this month that it was â€œfrankly disgustingâ€ that the press is â€œable to write whatever they want to write.â€ Clearly the president has an authoritarian bent when it comes to journalism. His latest comments fit with past labeling of straight news reporters as â€œdishonest,â€ â€œscumâ€ and the â€œenemy of the American people.â€ â€œI hate some of these people, I hate &aposem,â€ Trump said about reporters at a Michigan rally late last year, a month after he won the presidency. â€œI would never kill them. I would never do that.â€ He then paused smiled and joked, â€œNo, I wouldn&apost. I would never kill &aposem.â€ But he did direct tirades at straight news reporters covering his campaign and have his supporters turn to curse and threaten them at rallies. And Trump did ask his Twitter followers: â€œWith all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for the country.â€ A corrupt President Nixon expressed similar thoughts about going after television stations owned by The Washington Post during the paperâ€™s probe into the Watergate scandal. Trumpâ€™s appetite for shutting down the free press is a reminder of his open admiration for strong men dictators like Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin, Turkeyâ€™s Recep Erdogan and the Philippinesâ€™ Rodrigo Duterte. Those strongmen limit the freedom of the press and, in some cases, kill and jail journalists. Earlier this year, Sen.Â  John McCain , R-Ariz., responded to Trump calling the press the â€œenemyâ€ of the American people by saying that is â€œhow dictators get started.â€ Trump, like those dictators, wants to control what the public knows. His goal is to shape reality in order to manufacture public approval of his leadership â€” which is at an all-time low for a president during his first year. And as brazen as that strategy is in a country with constitutional protections for freedom of the press, the bigger shock is that it is having some success. This is especially true among Republicans. A Vanity Fair/60 Minutes poll from April found 36 percent of Republicans say they believe freedom of the press â€œdoes more harm than good.â€ Recently, the president called attention to a Politico/Morning Consult poll that found 46 percent of Americans believe the media â€œfabricates storiesâ€ to damage him and his administration. In the same poll, 37 percent said the media does not fabricate and 17 percent said they didnâ€™t know. Trumpâ€™s desire to make the American news media into his version of Pravda â€” the Russian governmentâ€™s propaganda sheet â€” is being criticized even by some on the right. â€œThis isnâ€™t a game. It isnâ€™t just Trump being Trump. It is a new front in his endless attack on a central pillar of our liberties â€” a free press,â€ GOP strategist Rick Wilson, a longtime critic of the president, wrote recently in the Daily Beast. Bernie Goldberg, a Fox News commentator, wrote this rebuke on his website: â€œAs with so many things, this president is just plain wrong. Journalists have biases; they make mistakes; sometimes theyâ€™re sloppy; and worst of all, sometimes they have a political agenda. But fabricating stories that they know are not true, inventing fake news sources: that is so rare as to be virtually nonexistent.â€ Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor and my colleague, said last week that Trumpâ€™s criticism of the press is now â€œway over the top.â€ Another colleague, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, said in a separate interview he dislikes media personalities who join Trump in â€œbashing the media, because oftentimes what they are bashing is stuff that we on the news side are doing.â€ As a journalist, I have been critical of President Trump. That has led to Twitter taunting against me by Trump. And then there are the countless racist and hateful comments posted to my social media pages by self-described Trump supporters. When National Public Radio (NPR) fired me in 2010 for speaking my mind about fear of Muslim terrorism, principled conservatives â€” even those who disliked me â€” rose to my defense and called NPR out for their censorship and thug tactics to stifle free speech. When the Obama administrationâ€™s press shop waged a campaign to delegitimize Fox News by excluding it from a White House pool interview in 2009, journalists â€” even those who didnâ€™t like Fox â€” stood up and said that was wrong. If people were outraged by what NPR did to me and what the Obama White House did to Fox, then their principles must dictate that they are similarly outraged by Trumpâ€™s treatment of the press. Recall what President Jefferson wrote in his famous letter to Edward Carrington: â€œWere it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.â€ How far weâ€™ve come from Jeffersonâ€™s wisdom to Trumpâ€™s ugly, ignorant threats.

Doug Collins, vice chair of the House Republican Conference and a member of the Judiciary Committee. One of the most powerful Democrat-linked families on K Street fought back Tuesday against the White House, Special Counsel Robert Mueller&aposs Russian investigation and evenÂ Fox News for reporting on the spiraling probe. The powerful Podesta family&aposs troubles came into view Monday with lobbyist Tony Podestaâ€™s mysterious resignation from his firm. That raised concerns that the brother of Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, John Podesta, might know more than heâ€™s letting on about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, â€œThe biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know(s) about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!â€ Trump did not say what specifically he thinks Podesta knows or how it affects the special prosecutorâ€™s case. John Podesta fired back at Trumpâ€™s accusations, tweeting â€œNot bad enough that I was the victim of a massive cyber crime directed by the Russian President. Now Iâ€™m the victim of a big lie campaign by the American President.â€ He added, â€œ@realDonaldTrump seems a lot more worried now than July 2016 when he asked the Russians to hack our campaign.â€ Big brother Tony Podesta has been a pivotal figure in DC, where he has made a fortune off lobbying efforts. He and his former wife, Heather Podesta, were well known around town for hosting fancy fundraisers for high-rolling Democratic clients in their home. On Monday, Tony Podesta stepped down from the firm he builtÂ as federal prosecutors probing claims of Russian interference charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his aide Rick Gates with money laundering. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment. Charges ranged from conspiracy against the United States to failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts. The indictment described Manafortâ€™s efforts to hide his lobbying tactics and money be made on behalf of the Party of the Regions. The Party of the Regions is a pro-Kremlin political base for Ukraineâ€™s former President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia three years ago. Manafort allegedly enlisted the help of The Podesta Group, which did work for a group known as the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The special counsel probe and Russia â€œhoax,â€ as the president has described it, has cast a cloud over the Trump administration. But last week, the White House enjoyed a shift in focus, amid new revelations in the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal and the payments behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier. In a Monday email to his staff, Podesta said he was stepping down because he ""needs to fight this as an individual, but doesn&apost want the firm to fight it,"" a person familiar with the farewell speech said. Dubbed one of DCâ€™s â€œ50 heavy liftersâ€ by the Financial Times and one of â€œWashingtonâ€™s biggest playersâ€ by The New York Times, Podesta turned his once-modest lobbying firm into a DC heavy hitter. But in the wake of the Mueller investigation the Podesta Group has struggled. About a half dozen of its clients have cut ties with the firm this year. The firm brought in an estimated $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, down from $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. On Monday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Tony Podestaâ€™s lawyer Geoff Garinther with Venable LLP, demanded the show â€œimmediately cease and desist disseminating false and misleading reports about Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.â€ â€œTony Podesta resigned as head of his company,â€ Carlson said on his tv show. â€œHis excuse? Us. Thatâ€™s right. He blamed us.â€ Last week, Carlson said the Podesta brothers were â€œcentral figuresâ€ in the federal investigation. Carlson also reported that Manafortâ€™s company, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, was a major client of the Podesta group.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/podesta-brothers-fight-back-against-trump-mueller-and-fox-news,Presidential,Fox News,

""I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday night. ""Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!"" Trump initially reacted to the terror attack in Lower Manhattan by saying it was done by a â€œsick and deranged person.â€ â€œIn NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person,â€ the president tweeted. â€œLaw enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!â€ Authorities said at least eight people died and 11 were injured after a driver plowed into a bike path in New York on Tuesday afternoon. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was shot by police and taken into custody following the attack. ""My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack,"" Trump later tweeted. ""God and your country are with you!"" Meanwhile, the president vowed to stop the Islamic State from executing terror attacks in the United States. ""We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere,"" Trump said. ""Enough!"" Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president has been briefed on the attack by chief of staff John Kelly and will be updated as â€œmore details are known.â€  â€œOur thoughts and prayers are with all those affected,â€ Sanders said. First lady Melania Trump also tweeted that her â€œheart breaksâ€ for her hometown. â€œMy heart breaks for  #NYC  today,â€ she tweeted. â€œThoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation.â€ The FBI is investigating the incident as terrorism, Fox News has learned. It is being jointly investigated by both the New York Police Department and the FBI.

31/10/2017 00:00,2017,10,31,The Wall Street Journal,The truth about Trump and the Manafort indictment,"close Video Manafort pleads not guilty to 12 counts of financial crimes The indictment alleged that while lobbying for Ukrainian interests from 2006-2015, Manafort laundered $75 million through offshore companies and bank accounts; James Rosen goes in-depth for 'Special Report.'
 Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for tax fraud on Monday, and the main charge against Donald Trump is poor judgment for hiring the notorious Beltway operator. The indictment accuses Mr. Manafort (and business partner Richard Gates ) of funneling money from a pro-Russia party in Ukraine into offshore shell companies and bank accounts. They then allegedly used these accounts to fund their spending habits, neglecting to declare the money to the IRS. The indictment also accuses Mr. Manafort of failing to register as an agent for a foreign government as required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). This is news mainly because violations of that law havenâ€™t been successfully prosecuted since 1966. The Russia probe has exposed the degree to which lobbyists ignore this statute that the Justice Department has failed to enforce. (Democrat Anthony Podesta announced Monday that he is leaving his lobbying firm amid the Mueller probe. He is the brother of John Podesta, who ran Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign.) The most striking news is that none of this involves the 2016 election campaign. The indictment makes clear that Mr. Manafortâ€™s work for Ukraine and his money transfers ended in 2014. The 2016 charges are related to false statements Mr. Manafort made to the Justice Department.

The smallest fish in the net hauled up Monday by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a ""liar"" and a low-level aide with a history of exaggerating his role in last year&aposs presidential campaign, according to President Trump and other administration officials. Listed as a former foreign policy adviser to President Trumpâ€™s campaign, the 30-year-old George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to the FBI. He allegedly tried to set up meetings between Team Trump and the Kremlin, then lied about to the FBI. But Papandopoulos, who President Trump on Tuesday branded a ""liar,"" appears to have greatly exaggerated his influence within the campaign. ""Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, a day after Mueller announced former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and his own aide, Rick Gates, had been indicted Friday and that Papandopoulos had pleaded guilty Oct. 5. MANAFORT, GATES PLEADED NOT GUILTY Papadopoulos was charged with lying to the FBI about his contacts with a UK professor with alleged ties to the Kremlin,Â according toÂ  court documents . Papandopoulos reportedly tried to enlist the professor&aposs help in connecting Trump&aposs campaign to Russian officials who had dirt on the Clinton campaign. But the professor cited in the official documents, Joseph Mifsud, the honorary director of the London Academy of Diplomacy, told The Telegraph he didn&apost tell Papadopoulos about any ""dirt"" the Russians may have had on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Mifsud also said it was a ""laughing stock"" that he would have introduced Papadopoulos to a ""female Russian national"" purported to be a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin. One former Trump campaign official told Axios&apos Jonathan Swan he was confused when the news of Papadopoulos&apos story broke on Monday. FORMER TRUMP AIDE GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS PLEADS GUILTY TO MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE FBI ""To be honest...I thought they were talking about [advance man] George Gigicos...not because he could&aposve possibly been involved with Russia, but because he&aposs the only guy with a Greek name that anyone knew on the campaign,"" the official said. Subsequent reporting has only unearthed a single Trump reference to Papadopoulos, made by the then-candidate during a Spring 2016 interview with the Washington Post editorial board. Trump, describing those who advised him on foreign policy, called Papadopoulos an ""energy and oil consultant, excellent guy. Papadopoulos is also seen in a March 2016 Instagram photo with Trump, Sessions and 10 other ""national security"" advisers. 
      Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was indicted on 12 counts by a federal grand jury on October 30, 2017 as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
       (AP) The Washington Post reported in April 2016 that Papadopoulos may have exaggerated his resume. Though he said he was a fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, a Hudson senior fellow disputed that, saying Papadopoulos was only an unpaid intern and then a contracted research assistant. Despite saying he was in attendance as a U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations, Papadopoulos&apos attendance wasn&apost remembered by two other members of the delegation Papadopoulos additionally said he was the keynote speaker at the 2008 annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Conference -- but the agenda lists former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as giving the keynote address. Still, critics say unlike the Manafort and Gates indictments, the Papadopoulos guilty pleaÂ could shed lightÂ on collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign. WHITE HOUSE DISTANCES ITSELF FROM MANAFORT, PAPADOPOULOS CHARGES White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders noted that Papadopoulosâ€™ guilty plea â€œhas nothing to do with the activities of the campaign, but his failure to tell the truth.â€ â€œHe was a volunteer on the campaign and a volunteer member of an advisory council that met one time,â€ Sanders said. Sanders said the White House expects special counsel Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russiaâ€™s meddling in the election to â€œconclude soonâ€ while accusing Democrats and Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign of colluding with the Russians. â€œThe real collusion scandal has everything to do with the Clinton campaign and Fusion GPS and Russia,â€ Sanders said. â€œThere is clear evidence of them colluding to spread disinformation and smear the president.

Trump insists Congress must end the visa lottery program under which Uzbek immigrant Sayfullo Saipov entered the country, and he has ordered still tighter scrutiny of immigrants already subject to what he calls ""extreme vetting."" But the White House is offering no indication of what new steps the president might be planning. Trump says, ""We have to get much tougher, much smarter, and less politically correct."" Trump says he is open to sending the suspect to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, instead of to trial in New York. However, prosecutors in New York have filed charges in federal court against Saipov. ___ 3:35 p.m. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the Trump administration considers the New York truck attack suspect to be an ""enemy combatant."" Sanders tells reporters President Donald Trump is open to sending the alleged attacker to the U.S. prison on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sanders says the actions of the alleged attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, justify the enemy combatant label. She says Trump isn&apost calling on Saipov to be moved to Guantanamo Bay, but says Trump ""certainly would support it if he felt like that was the best move."" Officials in New York say Saipov has yet to be formally charged in connection with the attack, which killed eight Tuesday. Sanders says the determination hasn&apost been made yet whether to move him out of the civilian justice system. ___ 3:25 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has spoken with the New York City mayor and the New York governor in the wake of a deadly truck attack near the World Trade Center. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders also says Trump&aposs calls for increasing extreme vetting of immigrants are ""something that frankly the president has been talking about for a long time."" Asked Wednesday about Trump&aposs critical tweets about New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Sanders says Trump ""has not blamed Sen. Schumer and doesn&apost feel that the senator is responsible for the attack."" ___ 12:50 p.m. The Department of Homeland Security says the suspect in the New York City truck attack entered the United States in 2010 under the diversity visa program. Homeland Security officials are confirming that the immigrant from Uzbekistan arrived in the U.S. that way. That&aposs the immigration program that President Donald Trump is calling on Congress to eliminate ""as soon as possible."" The president says the program is ""not good,"" and says the U.S. needs to ""get much tougher."" The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. ____ 12:49 p.m. Senate Republicans are coming to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer&aposs defense after President Donald Trump blamed him for the deadly New York attack. Trump tweeted that Democrats and Schumer were responsible for a diversity immigrant visa program he says was used by the alleged attacker to enter the United States. He arrived legally in 2010. Schumer was part of a group of Republicans and Democrats who backed a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 to end the program as part of a broader bipartisan bill to overhaul U.S. immigration laws. GOP Sen. John McCain was part of that group. He said the bill would have eliminated the program and replaced it with a merit-based system. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said of Trump criticism: ""Probably not the best way to bring out the best in our country."" North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said of Trump&aposs hit on Schumer: ""It&aposs not something I would do. We&aposve all got different styles. It&aposs not the way I would handle it."" ____ 12:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he will consider sending the suspected New York City truck attacker to the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Responding to a shouted question from a reporter at a Cabinet meeting, Trump says, ""I would certainly consider that. Send him to Gitmo."" Trump&aposs comments come after Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called on the president to treat the alleged attacker as an enemy combatant. The suspect is currently in custody in New York City, but according to officials has not yet been formally charged. Eight people died and at least 11 were seriously injured in the Tuesday attack. __ 12:05 p.m. President Donald Trump is calling the suspect in the New York City truck attack an ""animal."" Trump says he will ask Congress to ""immediately"" begin work to terminate the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which he says was used by the alleged attacker to enter the United States. Officials have not yet said that was the case. Trump says ""we will take all necessary steps to protect our people."" Speaking before a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said ""all of America is praying and grieving"" with the victims. He says: ""Our hearts break for them."" __ 12 p.m. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says that President Donald Trump&aposs attack against Sen. Chuck Schumer ""plays right into the hands of the terrorists."" The Democratic governor pointedly condemned Trump&aposs Wednesday tweets, which criticized Schumer&aposs immigration policy less than 24 hours after the deadliest terrorist attack in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. Cuomo said the president&aposs tweets ""were not helpful."" He added, ""You play into the hands of the terrorists to the extent you disrupt and divide... The tone now should be the exact opposite."" Both Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Trump had yet to reach out personally. Trump tweeted that Schumer is ""helping to import Europe&aposs problems."" He called the visa lottery program that allowed the suspect to enter the country ""a Chuck Schumer beauty."" The program was signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. __ 11:55 a.m. The Senate&aposs top Democrat says President Donald Trump&aposs response to the deadly attack in New York City ""doesn&apost work with New Yorkers"" or other Americans. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that after Sept. 11, 2001, Republican President George W. Bush united the nation, inviting lawmakers to the White House and promising to work together. Schumer said Trump is taking ""horrible advantage, of a tragedy"" and trying ""to politicize and divide. It doesn&apost work with New Yorkers and it doesn&apost work with Americans."" In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump blamed Schumer, saying the attacker came to the United States through a diversity visa program â€” ""a Chuck Schumer beauty."" Officials said the attacker is an immigrant from Uzbekistan who came to the United States legally in 2010. They haven&apost said whether he was admitted through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. __ 11:15 a.m. An AP Fact Check finds that President Donald Trump omitted key facts in blaming Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer for an immigration program Trump said allowed the driver in the New York truck attack to come to the U.S. Trump tweeted Wednesday that the attacker came into the U.S. through ""the &aposDiversity Visa Lottery Program,&apos a Chuck Schumer beauty."" Officials said the attacker is from Uzbekistan and came to the U.S. legally in 2010. They haven&apost said whether he was admitted through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program for those from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. The program was created as part of a bipartisan immigration bill introduced by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990. Schumer, D-N.Y., a House member then, proposed a program for ""diversity immigrants"" in a bill earlier that year. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., says Schumer was among a group of eight Republican and Democratic senators who proposed eliminating the program three years ago. __ 10:25 a.m. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer says President Donald Trump is ""politicizing and dividing America"" in the aftermath of Tuesday&aposs attacks in Manhattan that killed eight people and wounded 11. The Senate&aposs top Democrat said Trump â€” who attacked Schumer on Twitter Wednesday morning â€” ""should be bringing us together."" Trump tweeted that the accused attacker had entered the U.S. through a special diversity visa program that the president called ""a Chuck Schumer beauty."" Schumer said former President George W. Bush sought to unite the country after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said, ""the contrast between President George Bush&aposs actions after 9/11 and President Trump&aposs actions this morning could not be starker."" Schumer called upon Trump to rescind proposed cuts to anti-terrorism funding. __ 9:35 a.m. A Republican senator says President Donald Trump is unfairly blaming a Democrat for an immigration initiative that Trump says let the man who carried out the deadly New York City attack enter the United States. GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona says New York Democrat Chuck Schumer was among a group of eight Republican and Democratic senators who proposed eliminating the diversity visa program three years ago as part of a broader bipartisan bill to overhaul U.S. immigration laws. Flake, who served on the ""Gang of Eight"" with Schumer, says: ""I know. I was there."" The immigration bill ultimately failed in the GOP-led House after passing the Senate in June 2013. Flake recently announced he&aposs not running for re-election but says he won&apost be silent about Trump&aposs politics and behavior. ___ 8:25 a.m. The Senate&aposs top Democrat is hitting back after President Donald Trump faulted him for an immigration program that Trump says allowed the man in the deadly New York City bike path attack to enter the United States. Chuck Schumer says in a statement that ""I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America.""

Graham: Trump understands we're in a religious war Lawmaker reacts to the terror in New York City. Congressional Republicans rallied around President Trumpâ€™s calls for â€œextreme vettingâ€ Wednesday in the wake of the deadly Halloween terror attack in New York, with some of his fiercest GOP critics agreeing that the deadly incident shows a need for immediate reforms. Sayfullo Saipov, the ISIS-inspiredÂ fanaticÂ who allegedlyÂ carried out the attack that left eight dead and several injured, entered the United States in March 2010 from Uzbekistan under the Diversity Visa Program, according to authorities. Just hours after the attack, the president took to Twitter to announce he had ordered the Department of Homeland Security to â€œstep upâ€ the â€œalready Extreme Vetting Program.â€ While he was criticized by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, many Republicans are publicly supporting the presidentâ€™s move. â€œThe one thing I like about President Trump is that he understands weâ€™re in a religious war and to the American people, weâ€™re fighting people who are compelled by their religious view to kill us all,â€ Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., said on â€œFox News @ Nightâ€ Monday. â€œHe is right to make sure when somebody comes into our country from a place where radical Islam, and thatâ€™s the enemy, thrives, weâ€™re going to ask extra hard questions.â€ Graham went on to discuss the need for â€œmerit-based immigration,â€ and said â€œit makes no senseâ€ to â€œhand out visas and green cardsâ€ in a random way. What Graham was referring to was the Diversity Visa Programâ€”a State Department program which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America. Saipov entered the U.S. in 2010 under the program. Other Republican lawmakers also called for policy reforms, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said the program should be scrapped and replaced with a merit-based immigration. It was a rare moment of agreement between McCain and Trump, who blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for backing it back when he was a member of the House of Representatives. â€œThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the â€˜Diversity Visa Lottery Program,â€ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,â€ Trump tweeted early Wednesday. â€œWe are fighting hard for Merit Based Immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).â€ Republicans have long-criticized the program, and called for tighter borders, with Tuesdayâ€™s attack galvanizing much of their remarks. â€œThe lottery system, Iâ€™ve always been against it because itâ€™s randomâ€”completely random,â€ Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said on â€œFox & Friendsâ€ Wednesday. â€œI thought it should be merit-basedâ€¦I have been working with Chairman Goodlatte to abolish this system, and I think this case just further demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary.â€ Goodlatte, R-Va., said he has called for ending the diversity visa lottery â€œfor yearsâ€ and has sponsored legislation to do that. â€œThis flawed policy is just foolish in the age in which we live. Those in the world who wish us harm can easily engage in this statistical gamble with nothing to lose,â€ Goodlatte said in a statement Wednesday. â€œOur immigration policy should be based primarily on our national needs, security, and economics and not in part on any arbitrary system.â€ Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., even suggested a â€œsponsorshipâ€ program Wednesday on â€œAmericaâ€™s Newsroom,â€ saying there should be an â€œAmerican family who can be responsibleâ€ for those admitted into the country. â€œI agree with the president,â€ Paul said. â€œThere are certain countries with so much terrorism. Maybe we should stop certain countries from sending people here for a while. Itâ€™s not like you have a right to move to this country.â€ And Sens. David Perdue, R-GA., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., proposed eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery Program as part of the RAISE Act. â€œWhile Senate Democrats originally created the Diversity Visa Lottery in 1990, many have supported legislation that would have eliminated it in the years since,â€ Perdue said in a statement Wednesday. â€œI hope we can include this area of common ground as we work to fix our broken immigration system and strengthen our national security.â€ Even Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who announced his retirement last month and has repeatedly criticized Trump, said the approach toward immigration security has improved under the Trump administration. â€œWeâ€™re doing better and I think the president has stepped up efforts to make sure those who come in are properly vetted,"" Flake said. ""Thatâ€™s good."" But despite the new, and renewed, support from Republicans on Capitol Hill, there are many lawmakers who have slammed the president for â€œpoliticizingâ€ this weekâ€™s terror attack. â€œPresident Trump, where is your leadership?

Later Wednesday morning on the Senate floor, Schumer said that Trump, â€œinstead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be bringing us together.â€ Schumer also said Wednesday that the president â€œcanâ€™t refrain from his nasty, divisive habits,â€ and noted that the White House did not call him after the attack.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-lawmakers-back-trumps-call-for-tightening-immigration-law-in-wake-of-attack,TERROR,Fox News,
01/11/2017 00:00,2017,11,1,Associated Press,Could Trump send the New York terror suspect to Guantanamo?,"MIAMI â€“  President Donald Trump said Wednesday he would consider sending the suspect in the New York bike path attack to the Guantanamo Bay detention center. But just a few hours later, the government filed federal terrorism charges against suspect Sayfullo Saipov, signaling an intent to prosecute him within the U.S. The one-two developments marked a sharp disconnect between the president and his administration. Trump had professed himself to be open to the idea of sending Saipov to Guantanamo in a seemingly off-the-cuff answer to questions from reporters. ""I would certainly consider that, send him to Gitmo,"" Trump said, using the familiar shorthand for the detention center. The White House later reinforced that idea by saying it considered Saipov to be an ""enemy combatant."" But with the filing of federal charges, there was little indication that the threat of Guantanamo was anything more than tough talk. No one held within the U.S. has been sent to Guantanamo since the detention center opened in January 2002 to hold suspected members of al-Qaida and the Taliban. Still, elected officials routinely raise the prospect of doing so after attacks as a way to signal toughness in the fight against terrorism. Trump joined those ranks a day after a driver veered into a city bike path in Manhattan killing eight people. The president agreed that the U.S. base in Cuba would be an option for Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who authorities say was inspired by the Islamic State. The U.S. has to come up with a method of punishment that is ""far quicker and far greater than the animals are getting right now,"" Trump said. It is an open question whether the administration could send Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, in part because courts have not ruled whether the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force â€” which permits the government to detain enemy combatants for the duration of a military conflict â€” applies to the Islamic State and its followers, said Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The Islamic State did not exist when the authorization was passed. Vladeck noted that American criminal courts, which have secured hundreds of terrorism-related convictions since Sept. 11, have been more efficient than the military tribunal process at Guantanamo Bay. Just seven men have been convicted either by trial before military commission or through plea bargains, including four whose convictions were later overturned on appeal or invalidated. There are another seven held at Guantanamo still facing trial, including five men charged in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack and another accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Those cases are bogged down in pretrial litigation and are likely years from resolution. ""If the goal is to actually punish the perpetrator, then sending him to Guantanamo is just about the worst thing you can do,"" Vladeck said. The only advantage that Guantanamo might have is that men can be held there indefinitely without charge, said Bryan Broyles, the former chief defense counsel for the commissions, which combine elements of military and civilian court. ""There is no other benefit to Guantanamo,"" Broyles said. ""It&aposs more expensive. It&aposs harder to use. It&aposs slower to use and it lacks the legitimacy in the international community."" Amnesty International USA said it would be a ""grave mistake"" to send Saipov to Guantanamo. ""He&aposs a criminal suspect and should be treated as such by the U.S. justice system,"" said Daphne Eviatar, director of the group&aposs security with human rights program. Trump said during the campaign that he wanted to fill Guantanamo with ""bad dudes."" But the Justice Department last week opted to send a man accused of playing an instrumental role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks to federal court in Washington to face charges â€” not Guantanamo. Similarly, the U.S. on Wednesday indicted 36-year-old Mirsad Kandic in federal court in New York. Prosecutors say he recruited and facilitated the travel of foreign fighters to join the Islamic State and extradited him from Bosnia. In at least a physical sense, there are no practical reasons why the U.S. couldn&apost hold someone at Guantanamo. The detention center, which reached a maximum population of about 680 in the summer of 2003, is now down to just 41, and there is plenty of space for more. Asked if there were any plans to add anyone, a detention center spokeswoman had no immediate comment. The Pentagon and a base spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Sadie Gurman and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/could-trump-send-the-new-york-terror-suspect-to-guantanamo,TERROR,Fox News,

However, House Republican leaders see such a step as adding political complications to an already difficult task of crafting a tax bill that can pass the House and Senate. On Wednesday, the GOP blew past its self-imposed deadline for public release of the plan, with the rollout now set for Thursday. Trump set an ambitious by-Christmas timetable for passage of a major rewrite. It remains to be seen whether it will be the biggest tax cut ever as he claims. Tax writers decided to maintain the highest personal income tax rate at its current 39.6 percent and to slash the top tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent. The plan outline released last month by Trump and Republican leaders in Congress called for shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and to be determined.

01/11/2017 00:00,2017,11,1,Associated Press,Trump chooses visit to military base over DMZ,"WASHINGTON â€“  It has become something of a ritual for U.S. presidents trying to demonstrate their resolve against North Korea&aposs ever-escalating aggression. Beginning with Dwight Eisenhower&aposs visit to the front lines of wartime Korea, U.S. leaders have traveled to the barbed and mined demilitarized zone dividing the Korean Peninsula, peering across the barren north through binoculars, hearing broadcast propaganda, and reaffirming their commitment to standing with the South. After leaving the possibility of the visit dangling, the White House announced definitively Tuesday that President Donald Trump would not be following in their footsteps and will be forgoing a visit to the DMZ as he sets out on his maiden Asia trip. A senior administration official told reporters during a White House briefing that Trump will instead be visiting Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership and South Korea&aposs burden-sharing. His tight schedule, officials said, wouldn&apost accommodate both stops. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details ahead of the trip, noted that several Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence, had already made the trip to the border that has separated the North and South for 64 years. Trump&aposs trip comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric with North Korea, which has continued to pursue its missile and nuclear programs and ramped up its missile testing. In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would ""totally destroy"" the nation, if necessary. He has also derided North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as ""little Rocket Man."" Kim has returned the favor, calling Trump a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard."" The White House has played down the notion that its hesitation to send Trump to the DMZ stemmed from security concerns. But two people familiar with the administration&aposs thinking said that security issues had been discussed. The Secret Service, which advises on the president&aposs itinerary, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its recommendations. U.S. and South Korean officials also argued that a visit to Camp Humphreys, also known as United States Army Garrison-Humphreys, at the invitation of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, serves as a fitting symbol of the countries&apos ties and South Korea&aposs commitment to contributing to its own defense â€” a theme the president often pressed during his campaign. Some experts on the region also breathed a sigh of relief, arguing the trip could have further inflamed tensions between Trump and Kim. ""I would probably be begging him not to (go). No Secret Service likes to,"" said Dean Cheng, a China expert with the Heritage Foundation. He said that, given the recent exchange of words between Kim and Trump, a visit was ""probably more fraught with risk than your average presidential visit."" Others pointed to the symbolism of the president&aposs visit to the base. ""To me it was a no-brainer that he should go to Humphreys, this new base that they&aposve poured all this money into,"" said Jim Schoff, a former Pentagon adviser on East Asia policy and now senior fellow in the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Schoff said the base was ""perfect"" for Trump: ""It&aposs a big, massive real estate project and it&aposs South Korean-funded. It&aposs the big story of the alliance in recent times and it&aposs a great opportunity to highlight that,"" he said. Troy Stangarone, a senior director at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington, agreed that, with the move of United States Forces Korea to Camp Humphreys almost complete, ""a visit there sends a stronger signal about U.S. commitment to defend South Korea."" A trip to the DMZ , he said, ""could instead be misinterpreted and raise tensions on the Korean peninsula."" Visiting the wooded, craggy terrain inside the DMZ is like going back in time to 1953. In July of that year, the Korean War armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, the so-called ""truce village"" bisected by a marker that is the official dividing line between North and South Korea. This is the only area inside the DMZ where soldiers of North and South can stand nose to nose. In 1983, Ronald Reagan became first U.S. president to enter the DMZ â€” with South Korean artillery gunners standing poised to fire if necessary to protect him â€” and every president, barring one, has made the trip since. Trump&aposs predecessor, Barack Obama, visited during a 2012 trip to Seoul and told troops stationed at the border that ""the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity."" In 1993, Bill Clinton stood closer to North Korean territory than any Western leader, walking out on the ""Bridge of No Return"" and looking through binoculars at North Koreans about 50 yards away. He later recalled seeing young North Korean soldiers looking back at him and thinking: ""I wish you could walk over this bridge and I hope it won&apost be long until you can, until we put down the threat of nuclear war and open up the hand of friendship."" Pence said his visit earlier this year let North Koreans ""see our resolve in my face."" But Evans Revere, a former senior State Department official for East Asia, said that he was disappointed by Trump&aposs decision. He said a visit would have helped the president understand the human toll of any potential military action and see for himself just how close Seoul is to the border. ""By not visiting the DMZ, President Trump can only remind our allies, once again, that he does not view our alliance commitments in the same way as did every one of his predecessors,"" he said. ___ Associated Press National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-chooses-visit-to-military-base-over-dmz,MILITARY,Fox News,

           (REUTERS) CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta said Wednesday that President Donald Trump ""now has the world record for injecting politics into the aftermath of a terror attack"" after  Trump promised to end  the federal program that allowed New York City truck attacker Sayfullo Saipov to enter the U.S. Acosta made the comment in response to ""CNN Newsroom"" host Brooke Baldwin, who noted that Trump was ""pushing Congress for several major changes"" in the aftermath of Tuesday&aposs attack, which killed eight people and injured 12 others in Lower Manhattan.

In addition to vowing to end the State Department&aposs Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which is how suspect Sayfullo Saipov came into the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, Trump called for swift and harsh justice. â€œWe have to come up with a punishment that much worse than what these animals are getting now,â€ said Trump, who is asking Congress to end the diversity visa program. â€œWe have to come up with a punishment that much worse than what these animals are getting now."" â€” President Trump Sending Saipov to the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay would require, at a minimum,Â classifying him as an enemy combatant, something the White House said on Thursday they consider him to be. â€œI believe we would consider this person to be an enemy combatant, yes,â€ Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said during Wednesdayâ€™s briefing. Even then, the legality of such a move is not clear, as Saipov was a lawful resident of the U.S. and no terrorist has been sent to Gitmo under such circumstances. 
      Trump wants Saipov sent to Gitmo
       Sanders told reporters that when it comes to sending Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, the president â€œwould support thatâ€ but â€œhe wasnâ€™t necessarily advocating for it.â€ Saipov, 29,Â carried out his bloody rampage from behind the wheel of a rented pickup truck, barreling down a bike path along Manhattan&aposs West Side Highway Tuesday afternoon. Trump took aim Wednesday at the diversity immigration program, as well as others that allow â€œchain migration,â€ in which immigrants can enter the country simply to be united with a relative alreadyÂ living here. The type of visa Saipov possessed could theoretically have allowed dozens ofÂ his family members into the U.S. â€œWe will take all of the necessary steps to take care of our communities and our country has a whole,â€ Trump also said Wednesday. â€œWhat we have now is a joke and a laughingstock.â€ The president instead wants foreigners allowed into the country only under merit-based programs. â€œWeâ€™re so politically correct, weâ€™re afraid to do anything,â€ he said. 
 (Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, called for an end to the 'diversity' visa program) Earlier in the day, congressional Republicans also took aim at the diversity visa program. â€œIâ€™ve always been against it because itâ€™s a random system to bring people into the United States,â€ Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Wednesday on Fox Newsâ€™ â€œFox & Friends.â€  McCaul said heâ€™s trying to abolish the roughly 25-year-old program and replace it with a merit-based one. â€œI think this case just demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary,â€ he also said. Saipov was among the maximum 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the State Department diversity visa program, whichÂ tilts towardÂ â€œcountries with historically low rates of immigration.â€ McCaul spoke Wednesday just minutes after Trump called for a merit-based only immigration system and in part blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats for the program. â€œThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the â€˜Diversity Visa Lottery Program,â€™ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œNo more Democratic lottery,â€ Trump said in a follow-up tweet.

This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" November 1, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This animal who did the attack.  JOHN MILLER, NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER: Sayfullo Saipov, the 29-year-old legal permanent resident of the United States. TRUMP: He came in through the diversity program, as you know. An we&aposre going to stop that.  MILLER: It appears that Mr. Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks.  BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS: The reports now say that he is the hospital bed and he&aposs gleeful about what he did.  MILLER: He appears to have followed almost exactly to a t the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels.  TRUMP: Send him to Gitmo. I would certainly consider that, yes.  (END VIDEO CLIPS) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: So the sound today as we get the criminal complaint about this terror suspect in New York, eight people dead as a result of his actions. The president is considering some changes in policy, tweeting out today ""The terrorists came into our country through what&aposs called a diversity visa lottery program, a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit-based.""  The minority leader in the Senate responded, ""President Trump instead of politicizing and dividing America which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real situation, antiterrorism funding at which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget. I&aposm calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding.""  With that, let&aposs bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief of The Weekly Standard; Anna Palmer, senior Washington correspondent for Politico, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist. First, Steve, the details in this criminal complaint are pretty amazing, how much this terror suspect is gloating about the attack and how tied he is to ISIS or at least in the videos and propaganda around this.  STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Sometimes it&aposs hard to understand just how evil the people who want to attack us are. This makes it very clear how evil they are.  Look, I think what this attack makes clear as well is the United States needs to do a better job of looking carefully at who we are letting into the country. There&aposs no question about that. I didn&apost think a ban -- the original Muslim ban as proposed by then candidate Donald Trump was the answer. It was very clear, and I would think there would be bipartisan support for better scrutiny the people that we are letting in.  BAIER: The top recipients of the diversity visa program, as you put them up on a list here, Nepal, Egypt, Iran, the Republic of Congo, and Uzbekistan where this guy came from, 2,378 of them total. It seems like there may be a change in policy coming.  ANNA PALMER, POLITICO: I don&apost know. I think if you actually look at where immigration policy has been on Congress and this White House, it&aposs not gone anywhere. If anything there&aposs going to be something on DACA and DREAMers, probably before this actually happens. But you could see some kind of agreement on the funding issue. That&aposs going to be something that you will see maybe coming in the next couple of weeks.  BAIER: There were some channels, some Democrats pointing specifically to what they say is a dichotomy, a difference between the reaction to the Las Vegas shooting and the reaction today. Take a listen to this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS: I think one of the things we don&apost want to do is try to create laws that won&apost stop these types of things from happening.  TRUMP: We need strength, we need to resolve. We have to stop it. So we&aposre going to get rid of this lottery program as soon as possible.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: In other words you needed a day after the attack, it should be about the victims, not gun policy in one case or immigration policy in another.  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: There&aposs a really good argument for not politicizing events like this, waiting for families to be notified and having some time for people to process and mourn the lives of people who have died in these attacks.  It is really interesting to hear people who immediately politicized the Las Vegas tragedy which is a month ago, we still don&apost know what happened in that case, immediately moved to politicize it, blaming all American gun owners, now say that when you have someone like this guy who is proudly asking to hoist an ISIS flag in his room, we don&apost need to wait to find out what motivated him because he&aposs made it very clear what motivated him to say we can&apost address any political solutions is a very weird thing when they were singing such a different tune a month ago.  BAIER: It&aposs another big day, didn&apost get a lot of coverage out of places, but the release of these Usama bin Laden documents from the compound in Pakistan. Steve, you&aposve been following this from the very beginning, we&aposve been following it here on Fox. It&aposs a little frustrating in that there are almost a half million of these documents in Arabic as we try to go through them piece by piece. What are the highlights so far that you all see?  HAYES: I think this is important because it tells us about the evolving threat from jihadists and it tells us about the saw that the previous administration talked about that evolving threat. And if you look back at January 19th of this year, the DNI put out a statement in which they said we&aposre releasing the final cache of bin Laden document, bringing the total to 571 documents, 571. We have 470,000 documents released today. What that makes clear is the DNI, the Obama administration was not being honest about what they had.  The other thing in that January 19th, less than 24 hours before Barack Obama left office, in that release says that the relationship between Iran and Al Qaeda were characterized by hatred and suspicion. Well, we saw today the release of a wedding video of Hamza bin Laden, Usama bin Laden&aposs son. That wedding video was shot in Iran. There is a 19-page document detailing the relationship between Iran and Al Qaeda.  While there were certainly tensions, nobody should downplay those tensions, the senior Al Qaeda official who wrote that document said that we&aposve got everything we need from this. And Usama bin Laden in his own hand once called Iran the main artery for the growth and sustenance of Al Qaeda.  BAIER: So piece this together for somebody just following this. These documents are obtained at the rate of Usama bin Laden at the time the Obama administration officials said it was a treasure trove, a college library full of information. But yet we don&apost get them over all these years as the Obama administration says that Al Qaeda is on the run, bin Laden is dead, GM is alive. And yet now we are just going into what exactly the release was.  HAYES: I would go even further. They released selected documents. They released 17 documents in May of 2012 on the one-year anniversary of the raid. Those documents six months before the 2012 election were designed to show Usama bin Laden out of it, not really in charge, not with any day-to- day coordination of the network. And in fact now you see that the broader set of documents, and bin Laden was in charge of everything from crops that they were growing in Africa to maintaining the affiliates, to decentralizing power of Al Qaeda creating these strong affiliates around the world so that they couldn&apost be targeted by the United States. It&aposs a treasure trove now and I&aposm glad that historians and other experts are going to have an opportunity to look through it.  BAIER: And the question about Iran is a really big question especially because the Obama administration wanted that Iran deal so bad. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

01/11/2017 00:00,2017,11,1,Gregg Re,"Trump 'coming after' China unless it takes on North Korea, officials say","
          In this April 6, 2017 file photo, Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, smiles at U.S. President Donald Trump as they pose together with their wives for photographers before dinner at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. 
           (AP) As he prepares to embark Friday on a major 12-day foreign policy trip to five Asian countries, President Donald Trump is finalizing plans to secure Chinaâ€™s involvement in curbing the threat posed by North Korea, officials say. Trump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next Wednesday in Beijing, a day after a planned stop in South Korea. Senior administration officials have said Trump will have specific demands for his Chinese counterpart --- and will be prepared to threaten consequences if China does not abide them. Trump is expected to request that Xi impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with the rogue dictatorship, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime,  Reuters  reported. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea. Behind the scenes, Trump may also insist that the Chinese work to convince the North Korean government in Pyongyang to open nuclear disarmament discussions with Washington. But a former U.S. intelligence official who is informally advising the White House on Asia policy told the  Washington Times  that the administration is not entirely sure what it can accomplish during the presidentâ€™s visit to Beijing. Experts say it is likely that, even if Trump&aposs goals are uncertain of being achieved, the president will rely on various pressure points during his discussion with Xi. One indirect tool at Trumpâ€™s disposal, U.S. officials told Reuters, is the threat of imposing further economic sanctions on North Korea. The move could destabilize the already fragile North Korean economy and lead to a surge of poor refugees from North Korea into China, creating a logistical headache and a potential humanitarian crisis for Beijing. The president could also cause problems for Xi by formally investigating Chinese entities who administration officials say strong-arm U.S. companies into divulging proprietary intellectual property. The Washington Times reported that Trump, who first raised the issue with Xi during an August phone call, is prepared to renew the threat during next week&aposs meeting. And Trump, who has previously  threatened  to reduce Chinaâ€™s access to U.S. markets if it does not take a harder line on North Korea, will likely target the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China. China has the largest bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. of any country, by a significant margin. Trump will probably tell the Chinese president, ""â€˜Iâ€™m coming after you on trade,â€™â€ Christopher Johnson, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Washington Times. But Xi has sent signals that he may not be receptive to the White Houseâ€™s position. After North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un sent Xi a congratulatory message for recently winning a second term as Chinaâ€™s Communist Party leader, Xi called for â€œstableâ€ relations between the two countries. â€œI wish that under the new situation the Chinese side would make efforts with the [North Korean] side to promote the relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development,â€ Xi wrote, according to North Korea&aposs state-run  Korean Central News Agency . Xi added that China and North Korea should focus on â€œdefending regional peace and stability and common prosperity.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-coming-after-china-unless-it-takes-on-north-korea-officials-say,World,Fox News,
14/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,14,Fox News,The politics of Trump's Middle East strategy,"close Video The politics of Trump's Middle East strategy President Trump makes good on another campaign promise, moves the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" May 14, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Jerusalem is the seat of Israel&aposs government. Today we follow through on this recognition and open our embassy in the historic and sacred land of Jerusalem.  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: President Trump, by recognizing history have you made history. We are in Jerusalem and we are here to stay.  JARED KUSHNER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital, the same right that is enjoyed by every other country in the world.  SAEB EREKAT, PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR: We also witnessed today a ceremony of the prime minister of Israel and the administration of President Trump burying the peace price, burying the two-state solution, killing the hope in the minds of the people of the Middle East as a whole for the possibility of peace.  (END VIDEO CLIPS) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It was a campaign promise and it has been delivered. The U.S. embassy moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Other countries have followed suit or are in the process of doing that. The United States is the first one, but Guatemala this week, Paraguay, Honduras, Romania has a proposal to move its embassy, would be the first EU member to do so very soon. Democrats supporting this. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, saying ""In a long overdue move we have moved our embassy to Jerusalem. Every nation should have the right to choose its capital. I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago, and I applaud President Trump for doing so.""  Obviously there were other people who had a real problem with it, including many Palestinians who took to the streets today. Some 40,000 Palestinian staged demonstrations along the border. More than 50 people were killed in the rioting there, 2,300 wounded, and some of the Arab street weighing in on all of that today as well.  Let&aposs bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief for The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and we welcome former National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton. Michael, let me start with you. This was the plan for a long time. Has it gone as planned, do you think?  MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: It&aposs more than a campaign promise. First of all, this is U.S. law for, I think, 23 years, passed in 1995. And this is one of the things, I just want to point out, that I think drives middle America, the average American crazy about Washington. Congress passes a law with overwhelming bipartisan support, puts a waiver provision in it so the will of the people through their elected representatives is that this should happen. And every six months every president waives it, waives it, waives it, and it never happens. It&aposs a kind of theater in a way. And then a president finally fulfills the terms of the law, and you saw this, yes, he&aposs got some support, but a lot of his domestic political critics level all kinds of accusations at him when I thought as the terms of the law this was bipartisan consensus for two decades.  BAIER: So on the bigger picture, Mara, on the Middle East peace process and where this goes, what does this do to that?  MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think that&aposs the big question, kind of now what? It&aposs not unlike getting out of the Iran deal. OK, now what are you going to do next? The Middle East peace proposal from the Trump administration has yet to be unveiled. As you heard the Palestinian leader, they are not inclined to enter talks now they feel the United States is no longer an honest broker. It&aposs just totally on Israel&aposs side.  So I think now the ball is in the president&aposs court. And he has to come up with the next steps for Middle East peace if that&aposs what he wants. If he just wanted to fulfill a campaign promise, he has certainly done that.  BAIER: Mollie?  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: I think it is awful to see what we saw, the loss of life with so many Palestinians being killed. And The Washington Post had reported that they were told, that Hamas had told them that Israel was not manning these sites on the border and it was causing people to rush, and then they was found that they were manned. That is a very sad to see and it&aposs not fun to watch.  It is also true, though, that I think that this could, in the long term, lead to a greater chance for peace. We have the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. And it is important that everyone acknowledge that, and it&aposs time for Palestinians to acknowledge that, and that dealing with reality is a good way to get move forward towards a peace agreement which people hope for.  BAIER: Steve?  STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: There are other things taking place behind the scenes around the subterranean level that suggest that there is some move toward peace. When you talk about the talks that are happening out of public eye between Israel and the Saudis, or the support, the common values on the Iran deal between Israel and the Saudis, Israel and UAE, the Bahrainis stepping up and speaking out in favor of the withdrawal of the Iran deal. I think you&aposre seeing these moves. This gets a lot of headline particularly because of the loss of life, but there are other indications that are much more positive.  And this is something that Donald Trump campaigned on. This something that he said. I think Mike is exactly right. This is something that you had presidents of both parties saying for literally decades, and they didn&apost do it. He did it.  BAIER: The equation of pulling out of the Iran deal, then moving the embassy, and those two things together, how do they interchange? How do they interlock? How do they affect each other?  ANTON: Well, I think that -- first of all I just want to follow up on a point that Steve made there. I think when you missed an opportunity, I don&apost think this -- it&aposs really the Palestinians that are missing the opportunity. It&aposs really the Palestinians that need to come back to the table. That&aposs what&aposs important here.  If the Palestinians, if Mahmoud Abbas would just come back and talk to this administration, talk to this president and sit down, I think he would fight an incredible willingness and eagerness to get a deal done. I have heard President Trump talk about this so many times. There&aposs an old saying that goes around Washington, people who have dealt with this issue, that the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And that&aposs what they are doing now.  I think it&aposs also interesting that what you are seeing is a lot of this is coming out of Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas and run by Hamas, right, and you are not seeing this intensity come outs of the West Bank. This is clearly being ginned up for political purposes. And the White House is so concerned. Look, what&aposs only a couple weeks ago that the White House hosted a conference on the future of Gaza and how to improve its infrastructure and improve the lives of the people. Got the Gulf Arab states to show up and pledge some aid. These are states that don&apost like to talk to one another in some respects because of the dispute in the Gulf and don&apost like to be in the same room with Israeli representatives, and they were all there. I think that was another positive and hopeful sign if only the Palestinians would embrace the possibilities that I think President Trump is opening up for them.  BAIER: I guess the question is, does the Arab street change now because of the different relationship with the Trump administration and the Gulf states as far as how they react to both things, the Iran deal and this move?  HEMINGWAY: There is, it does seem a reshaping in the Middle East from what we had seen in the previous administration with an effort to make Iran more dominant and the -- but I think it remains to be seen how they respond.  BAIER: Mara?  LIASSON: I come back to this question, if the United States is going to be the leader and is going to put forward a peace plan it needs to do that. The Palestinians will come to the table if they see a good plan where there is something in it for them. Right now they don&apost know what it is.  HAYES: For years, Middle East peace has been used as something to block progress in other areas in the region. The foreign policy establishment says you have to solve Middle East peace first, and then you can address threats from Iraq, you can address jihadism, you can address Iran, you can address all these other things. I think this sends a message pretty clearly that&aposs not going to be an obstacle anymore. Take that, set to the side, and deal with threats like Iran on a realistic basis.  BAIER: So it changes the paradigm, it changes the starting point?  HAYES: Brit said it earlier in the show. You are dealing with reality here. This is a more realistic look at the way that the Middle East is unfolding.  BAIER: Final word. ANTON: One thing, too, is keep in mind that Iran is a big supporter of Hamas. A lot of the wealth that Iran is able to take in because of the Iran deal on frozen assets and then the wealth that they were able to generate by being allowed to do business with countries that used to sanction them, they are spending that to destabilize the Middle East and fund terror. They&aposre funneling in to Hamas and other groups like this. And hopefully with the U.S. out of the Iran deal, perhaps some new sanctions and some other secondary sanctions going back into effect, some of that resource funnel gets choked off, gets reduced, and Iran doesn&apost have the resources, or it has fewer resources to spread mayhem, chaos, and violence the way it has been doing.

President Trump lashed out at American immigration laws during a dinner with Republican governors Monday night, saying that the statutes were ""the worst anywhere in the world as far as stopping people from coming in."" Trump said that the only reason immigrants enter the U.S. unlawfully is because of ""our weak laws that have been given to us by weak people in Congress.

          â€œCNN Tonightâ€ host Don Lemon said that ""racist"" President Trump watches his show on a regular basis.
           Don Lemon, the CNN star who has been blasted by President Trump as a â€œlightweightâ€ and â€œdumb as a rock,"" recently labeled the commander in chief a ""racist."" Lemon sat down with Mark McKinnon for an interview that aired Sunday on Showtimeâ€™s â€œThe Circusâ€ to explain how the â€œCNN Tonightâ€ host keeps his facts straight while covering the Trump administration. McKinnon pointed out that Trump regularly mocks CNN but â€œvery rarelyâ€ goes after specific reporters, with Lemon being among the individuals who have come under attack. â€œHmm,â€ Lemon said before laughing. â€œWhy do you think? Why do you think?â€ McKinnon responded by saying that Trump usually goes after people who bother or threaten him â€“ but the CNN star didnâ€™t buy it. â€œMy feelings about this president have been known. Iâ€™ve said it on the air. I think that he is racist,â€ Lemon said. â€œI think his actions show it. I think the facts show it. Does he attack me for that reason? I donâ€™t know. It could be part of the equation.â€ ""My feelings about this president have been known. Iâ€™ve said it on the air. I think that he is racist."" â€” CNN host Don Lemon Trump has targeted numerous reporters in recent memory, including The New York Timesâ€™ Maggie Haberman, MSNBCâ€™s Katy Tur and CNNâ€™s Jim Acosta. Lemon then declared that Trump watches CNN every night although heâ€™ll â€œsay that he doesnâ€™t,â€ because the president likes hearing about himself. Lemon also speculated about why the president doesnâ€™t attack MSNBC as frequently as he goes after CNN. â€œI donâ€™t really think MSNBC matters to him, not that they donâ€™t matter, but I think to him, because itâ€™s so far left, I donâ€™t think that matters to him,â€ Lemon said. â€œI know heâ€™s watching [CNN].â€ McKinnon then reminded Lemon that Trump famously called him â€œdumb as a rockâ€ inÂ  a 2016 tweet . â€œWhatever he says, itâ€™s the opposite,â€ Lemon said. â€œDumb people donâ€™t usually do two hours a night of primetime.â€ Earlier in the interview, Lemon explained that politics were not initially his â€œforte,â€ as he started out as a general assignment reporter, but he has educated himself along the way. â€œSometimes, I swear, I canâ€™t keep up with it,â€ Lemon said before revealing a stack of documents he uses to fact check for his program. â€œWhen you have an administration and a president that is factually challenged, you have to get your facts straight. You have to be on your game,â€ Lemon said. â€œIt all matters.â€ President Trump often refers to CNN as â€œfake news,â€ but Lemon defended his network by stating that â€œmostâ€ of the things it reports turn out to be accurate. Lemon recentlyÂ  hosted a â€œSag Harbor soireeâ€ at his vacation home Â in the prestigious Hamptons area east of New York City. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels,Â was among the guests â€“ as Juanita ScarlettÂ  revealed on Wednesday night via twitter . Last week,Â  Lemonâ€™s boyfriend shockingly admitted Â they run in the same circle as Avenatti during an impromptu conversation with a reporter that the porn lawyer has threatened over unfavorable coverage. Tim Malone, a media ad sales executive,Â made the disclosure in a Twitter direct messageÂ conversation with Daily Caller reporter Joe Simonson. It cameÂ after AvenattiÂ appeared on ""CNN Tonight"" on the heels of aÂ  Daily Caller report on Avenatti&aposs allegedly shady past dealings .Â Lemon gently broached the issue,Â  asking Avenatti about his threats Â against the conservative news site, but failed to push for an answer regarding what exactly bothered him. â€œYou donâ€™t think Avenatti is smart enough to try and befriend the liberal media?â€ Malone said, according to Simonson, implying that Lemon and the attorney are friends.

21/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,21,Judson Berger,"Trump turns up heat on Obama, Brennan amid 'informant' questions","close Video Trump demands DOJ probe Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano on President Trump calling on the Department of Justice to investigate allegations the FBI spied on his 2016 presidential campaign. President Trump sought to turn the tables on the Obama administration Monday after demanding a probe into whether his predecessorâ€™s FBI â€œinfiltratedâ€ his 2016 campaign, pointedly asking what then-President Barack Obama knew about the operation â€“ while clashing with former CIA boss John Brennan. Following reports detailing how  an FBI â€œinformantâ€ had multiple contacts with members of Trumpâ€™s campaign, the president said Sunday heâ€™d formally seek a DOJ probe of whether agents surveilled the campaign for political purposes, and whether any such demands came from the Obama administration. While the DOJ swiftly asked the departmentâ€™s inspector general to handle that review, the president turned the spotlight Monday to Obama. â€œThe Wall Street Journal asks, â€˜WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?â€™ A very good question!â€ Trump tweeted. He was referring to an op-ed  calling on Obama to explain â€œhis administrationâ€™s surveillance of affiliates of a presidential campaign.â€ The column from James Freeman posited that Obama was likely â€œfairly well-informedâ€ about his law enforcement agencies, but said if he was unaware of the Russia probeâ€™s full history, â€œthen it would seem a public explanation is also in orderâ€”about his management, and about just how far the â€˜deep stateâ€™ went without specific presidential approval.â€ Video Meanwhile, another dust-up between the president and Brennan took shape as the former CIA director, and now MSNBC/NBC contributor, warned Republican leaders in Congress not to â€œenableâ€ Trump, in response to his call for an investigation. â€œSenator McConnell & Speaker Ryan: If Mr. Trump continues along this disastrous path, you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy. You do a great disservice to our Nation & the Republican Party if you continue to enable Mr. Trumpâ€™s self-serving actions,â€ Brennan tweeted, while also quoting Roman philosopher Cicero: â€œAny man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.â€ Trump fired back by quoting, at length, former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino on â€œFox & Friends,â€ as Bongino accused Brennan of sparking the entire Russia probe and taking part in a politically motivated investigation. Brennan has been a vocal critic of Trump ever since he took office. The precise origins of the Russia probe remain unclear. Officials have previously pointed to comments Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly made about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton as touching off the investigation in July 2016.  A House GOP memo  released earlier this year affirmed this timeline. But reporting over the weekend in The New York Times and Washington Post said an informant was also talking to Papadopoulos and other Trump figures in 2016. The details have raised questions about what prompted those contacts. The revelations come amid a tense dispute between the Justice Department and House Republicans who have been seeking details about the informantâ€™s role. Trump referenced that standoff on Saturday, tweeting: â€œOnly the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!â€ The FBIâ€™s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump figures would eventually be taken over by Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team. The intelligence community, and Senate Intelligence Committee, have since declared that Russia did seek to interfere in the election, largely to boost Trump over Clinton. Video But in looking to turn up new information on how the probe began â€“ and suggesting political motivations were at play â€“ Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill could undermine the Muellerâ€™s probe just as Trump and his legal team are weighing the possibility of a Trump interview with the special counsel. Meanwhile, Obama has said little about the probeâ€™s beginnings, and itâ€™s unclear if he plans to enter this highly charged debate. One of the few references to his involvement came in texts released earlier this year from anti-Trump FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. In one of them, the two discussed preparing talking points for then-FBI boss  James Comey to give Obama , who wanted to â€œknow everything weâ€™re doing.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-turns-up-heat-on-obama-brennan-amid-informant-questions,Russia Investigation,Fox News,"

Police on Monday released dramatic video showing a firefight between officers and the suspect who stormed the lobby of the Trump National Doral Golf Club early Friday carrying an American flag and shouting derogatory words about the president. The video from the Miami-Dade Police Department, according to  WSVN , showed an officer firing and ducking for cover. Officers could be heard shooting back and forth as they moved through the hotel looking to neutralize the suspect. According to police, 42-year-old Jonathan Oddi fired at a chandelier before exchanging gunfire with officers, who shot him in the legs and took him into custody. Miami-Dade County jail records showed Oddi was booked Sunday evening while still wearing what appeared to be a hospital gown.

       Oddi was held without bond on charges of 2nd-degree attempted murder, aggravated assault with a firearm, burglary with assault, criminal mischief, grand theft and falsely pulling a fire alarm. A Doral police officer suffered a fractured wrist during the exchange, authorities said. â€œYou know, these officers did not hesitate one second to engage this individual that was actively shooting in the lobby of the hotel,â€ Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez said. â€œThey risked their lives knowing that that they had to get in there to save lives in that hotel.â€ Eric Trump, the presidentâ€™s son and executive vice president of the Trump organization, tweeted early Friday, â€œA huge thank you to the incredible men and womenâ€ of the departments, adding that â€œevery day they keep our community safe.â€ The golf resort previously known as the Doral Resort & Spa was purchased by the Trump Organization in 2012. Its signature course is the Blue Monster at Doral. The Trump National Doral, which includes several buildings for lodging and an expansive clubhouse, is among the largest hotels in the Miami suburb. Itâ€™s about 8 miles from Miami International Airport. Its website describes it as an 800-acre resort with 643 total guest rooms, more than 100,000 square feet of event space and four golf courses.

President Donald Trump on Monday is expected to attend the swearing-in of the CIA&aposs first female director. The ceremony for Gina Haspel is set to take place at agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Haspel won Senate confirmation last week after overcoming concerns about her role in the agency&aposs use of harsh interrogation techniques after 9/11. The 33-year CIA employee was backed by many in the CIA rank and file and senior intelligence officials, including former CIA directors and national intelligence directors. Opponents argued it was wrong to reward someone who supervised a covert detention site in Thailand where terror suspects were harshly interrogated. Haspel, an Air Force brat from Ashland, Kentucky, joined the CIA in January 1985 when she was 28. At the time, then-CIA Director William Casey was working to counter Soviet expansion, curtail Moscow&aposs influence, win the Cold War, and bolster up U.S. intelligence operations. She didn&apost become a reports officer, analyzing information from the field; that was the most likely career track for a woman in the CIA at that time. Instead, Haspel chose to be a case officer out in the streets, meeting assets and collecting intelligence. Details of Haspel&aposs career are sketchy because much of it remains classified, including places where she was posted, but the CIA has provided an overview. Trump tapped the 61-year-old Kentucky native to lead the nation&aposs premier intelligence agency after he nominated then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to succeed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.

Â Giuliani said he and Mueller spoke about an end date to the investigation approximately two weeks ago. During that conversation, Giuliani told Mueller that any interview of Trump by the special counsel would be contingent on knowing when the probe would wrap up.Â Giuliani added that he wants Mueller&aposs investigation wrapped up by Sept. 1 so that it doesn&apost affect Republican chances in November&aposs midterm elections.

Â Trump focused on Podesta in one of a series of tweets Sunday attacking Special Counsel Robert Mueller&aposs investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In October, reports emerged that Mueller was investigating the Podesta Group over its lobbying work on behalf of a nonprofit group called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECMU). According to the special counsel&aposs indictment of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and associate Rick Gates, the Brussels-based ECMU functioned as a ""mouthpiece"" for Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine&aposs pro-Russian president between 2010 and 2014.

Clinton admitted that she still thinks about her defeat by Trump: ""No, I&aposm not over it. I still think about the 2016 election. I still regret the mistakes I made.

President Trump touted progress in trade negotiations with China on Monday following criticism that Beijing might be getting the better of the administration. â€œI ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didnâ€™t President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen!â€ Trump tweeted early Monday. The presidentâ€™s tweet comes after high-level talks in Washington last week. Beijing agreed in a joint statement with the U.S. to Â â€œsubstantially reduceâ€ Americaâ€™s trade deficit with China, but did not commit to cut the gap by any specific amount. The Trump administration has sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion. MNUCHIN SAYS US HAS DEAL WITH CHINA TO CUT TRADE DEFICIT, WILL HOLD OFF ON TARIFFSÂ  In a written statement Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ""President Trump has created a unique opportunity but the people doing the negotiating shouldnâ€™t blow it. There is nothing wrong with these talks but the proof of the pudding is in the eating."" He called for China to take ""strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft, and American companies having free access to sell goods in China."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday   said that the U.S. and China have reached a tentative deal to cut trade deficits that includes the U.S. putting China tariffs on hold, an agreement that potentially averts an economic standoff. Mnuchin said that tariffs would be put on hold while the countries try to execute the framework agreement. Mnuchin also said the U.S. expects to see farm sales to China increasing 35 to 45 percent this year alone. â€œChina has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Productsâ€”would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!â€ Trump tweeted Monday. â€œOn China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time.â€ But Trump has faced criticism, including from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. â€œIf putting tariffs â€˜on holdâ€™ means that while we â€˜talkâ€™ #China gets to continue to block U.S. companies but do whatever they want here & to steal intellectual property then #China has out negotiated the U.S. again,â€ Rubio tweeted on Sunday. â€œIf we make a deal in which #China promises to buy $200 billion from U.S. in exchange for business as usual, the current administration will become the latest example of a White House so desperate for a deal they get beat badly by China in negotiation.â€ The Trump administration proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and Trump later ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to seek up to an additional $100 billion in Chinese products to tax. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., however, praised the administration&aposs actions, noting it was â€œsmart to engage China on trade abusesâ€ and would also be â€œsmart to get them more involved in trying to help us with North Korea.â€ The president echoed that sentiment on Twitter early Monday. â€œChina must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!â€ Trump tweeted. The president is slated to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, though the rogue regime has threatened to cancel talks following military exercises practiced by South Korea and U.S. North Korea canceled a high-level summit with South Korea last week.

          Bruce Ohr, left, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
           (AP) The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Justice Department Monday to turn over communications between former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, British spy Christopher Steele and others about the infamous anti-Trump dossier. In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, requested Ohr&aposs emails, phone logs, written notes and text messages. Grassley also asked the Justice Department to arrange for Ohr to be interviewed by Committee staff. Grassley wrote that he wants to know whether Ohr continued to pass information from Steele to others at the FBI after the bureau terminated the former MI6 man as a source for disclosing his relationship with the FBI to the media. JUDICIAL WATCH SUES DOJ FOR BRUCE AND NELLIE OHR RECORDS RELATED TO FUSION GPS, DOSSIERÂ  In February, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee claimed that Bruce Ohr&aposs wife, Nellie, was â€œemployed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition researchâ€ on then-candidate Donald Trump. They alleged that Bruce Ohr passed the research, which had been paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, on to the FBI. The Steele dossier, which was published by BuzzFeed News in January 2017, included detailed claims about Trump&aposs business ties to Russia and salacious assertions about his private life. The relationship between Steele and the Ohrs was ""inexplicably concealed from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC),"" during the FBIâ€™s effort to obtain a FISA warrant on former Trump campaign official Carter Page, House intel Republicans alleged in a memo. DOJ OFFICIAL WHO CONCEALED MEETINGS WITH TRUMP DOSSIER FIGURES LOSES ANOTHER JOB TITLEÂ  In December, Fox News reported that Ohr had been stripped of his title of associate deputy attorney general and booted from his office near Rosenstein&aposs at Justice Department headquarters. The demotion came after it was revealed that he had conducted undisclosed meetings with Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson. The following month, Ohr was stripped of his second post as head of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Fox News reported at the time that Ohr was involved in Project Cassandra, an interagency investigation spearheaded by the DEA that tracked a massive international drug and money laundering scheme allegedly run by Hezbollah. Ohr is believed to still be working at the Department of Justice, though his exact position is unclear.

21/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,21,Associated Press,Moon enters talks with Trump with driver's seat at stake,"close Video Moon urges Trump to keep North Korea summit on track Trump-Kim summit looks less certain after recent developments. Benjamin Hall reports. SEOUL, South Korea â€“  For a few months, everything seemed to be clicking for South Korean President Moon Jae-in as he pieced together crucial nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea following a year of intense animosity. But he now enters a White House meeting with President Donald Trump with his status in the diplomatic driver&aposs seat in doubt. Pyongyang&aposs surprise move last week to break off a high-level meeting with Seoul over U.S.-South Korean military drills while threatening to cancel next month&aposs summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump cooled what had been an unusual flurry of diplomatic moves from the country after a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests. It also underscored Seoul&aposs delicate role as an intermediary between Washington and Pyongyang and raised questions about Moon&aposs claim that Kim has genuine intent to deal away his nukes. Seoul may lose much of its voice if Trump chooses to deal more directly with China, North Korea&aposs only major ally, which is refusing to be sidelined in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff. Seoul&aposs presidential office said this week&aposs meeting between Moon and Trump will be mainly focused on preparing Trump for his summit with Kim, scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. A look ahead at the Moon-Trump meeting and the challenges they face with Kim: ___ WHITE HOUSE TO SINGAPORE Seoul insists Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities, materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way in exchange for credible security and economic guarantees. Moon and Trump will likely discuss potential steps that Trump can put on the table in Singapore. Their meeting at the White House may also include discussions on setting up three-way talks with Pyongyang or four-way talks also including Beijing to negotiate a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. Moon and Trump may exchange views on whether the allies should temporarily modify their joint military drills while engaging in denuclearization negotiations with North Korea, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul&aposs Dongguk University and a policy adviser to Moon. There could also be deeper discussions on the future of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. South Korea maintains an optimistic outlook for the Trump-Kim talks. Moon&aposs foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, told South Korean lawmakers last week that the North has issued a commitment for ""complete denuclearization."" However, she said there&aposs a ""difference in opinions between the North and the United States over the methods to achieve denuclearization."" Officials in Washington have talked about a comprehensive one-shot deal where the North fully eliminates its nukes first and receives rewards later. But Kim, through two separate summits with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in March and May, has called for a phased and synchronized process where every action he takes is met with a reciprocal reward from the United States. ___ THE DREADED ""D&apos&apos WORD Despite Seoul&aposs reassurances, it remains unclear whether Kim will ever agree to fully relinquish his nukes, which he likely sees as his only guarantee of survival. For decades, North Korea has been pushing a concept of ""denuclearization"" that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops from South Korea and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. Kim declared his nuclear force as complete in November, following the country&aposs third flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. At a ruling party meeting in April, the North announced that it was suspending all nuclear and ICBM tests and will close its nuclear testing ground because its mission had come ""to an end."" The announcements were clearly designed to communicate that Kim sees himself as entering the negotiations with Trump from a position of strength and expects to be treated as a leader of a full-fledged nuclear state. ""The success of the Trump-Kim meeting will be determined by whether it turns out to be a denuclearization negotiation or an arms reduction negotiation between two nuclear states,"" said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul&aposs Asan Institute for Policy Studies. ""So far, the North has built conditions for the meeting to become the latter."" Trump may find it difficult to politically justify a deal with North Korea that&aposs significantly less than a ""complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization"" when he just abandoned a major nuclear deal with Iran that he claimed was too weak. But it&aposs not clear whether he can coax a stronger deal from North Korea than the one Barack Obama got from Iran. Iran&aposs nuclear program is nascent and its weapons capability theoretical. North Korea&aposs arsenal now includes purported thermonuclear warheads and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of striking the continental United States. ___ CHAMPAGNE POPPED TOO EARLY? While Seoul can be credited for coordinating the diplomatic approach toward North Korea, South Korean officials may have been too optimistic about the signs they were seeing from Pyongyang. During a March visit to the White House where Trump agreed to a summit with Kim, Moon&aposs national security director, Chung Eui-yong, said Kim told visiting South Korean officials in Pyongyang that he ""understands"" that the joint military exercises between the allies ""must continue."" This was then seen as an important departure from the past, when the North thoroughly rejected the drills. But Kim has yet to deliver any similar comment on record. In lashing out last week against the U.S.-South Korean drills and Trump&aposs hard-line national security adviser, John Bolton, North Korea used familiar language to justify its nuclear weapons, saying the United States must eliminate its ""hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail"" against the North as a ""precondition for denuclearization."" It&aposs possible that Chinese President Xi persuaded Kim to adopt a tougher stance over U.S.-South Korean drills during their summits, Cha said. Kim might have asked China to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. He also might have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again. ""It&aposs hard to say there are clear signs that the North is employing a meaningfully different approach on denuclearization,"" Cha said. ___ Follow Kim Tong-hyung on Twitter at @KimTongHyung.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/moon-enters-talks-with-trump-with-drivers-seat-at-stake,MILITARY,Fox News,

President Trump on Monday met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, a day after demanding a DOJ investigation into whether the FBI â€œinfiltratedâ€ his 2016 campaign. â€œBased on the meeting with the president, the Department of Justice has asked the Inspector General to expand its current investigation to include any irregularities with the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s or the Department of Justiceâ€™s tactics concerning the Trump Campaign,â€ White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Sanders said it was also agreed to that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will â€œimmediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested.â€ The president made the investigation demand on Sunday, followingÂ  reports detailing how Â an FBI â€œinformantâ€ had multiple contacts with members of Trumpâ€™s campaign. Trump said he would formally seek a DOJ probe of whether agents surveilled the campaign for political purposes, and whether any such demands came from the Obama administration. Within hours, the DOJ had asked the departmentâ€™s inspector general to handle such a review. And, Rosenstein said in a Sunday statement: â€œIf anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.â€ â€œThe White House plan to arrange a meeting where â€˜highly classified and other informationâ€™ will be shared with members of Congress is highly irregular and inappropriate. The president and his staff should not be involved in the viewing or dissemination of sensitive investigatory information involving any open investigation, let alone one about his own activities and campaign,â€ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded. â€œHowever, if such a meeting occurs, it must be bipartisan in order to serve as a check on the disturbing tendency of the presidentâ€™s allies to distort facts and undermine the investigation and the people conducting it.â€ The focus of Mondayâ€™s meeting was expected to be the Justice Departmentâ€™s response to congressional requests â€“ something that directly relates to the presidentâ€™s weekend tweets, as GOP lawmakers have been locked in a heated dispute with DOJ over access to information about the apparent informant. Congressional Republicans have been seeking documents relating to the confidential informant who helped investigate potential Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, but the Justice Department has opposed the move citing the sensitivity of the matter. Vice President Pence, in an interview Monday with Fox Newsâ€™ Martha MacCallum, said Trump was â€œgratefulâ€ that the DOJ was having the inspector general â€œlook into and determine and ensure that there was no surveillance done for political purposes against our campaign.â€ He added, â€œI think it would be very troubling to millions of Americans if that took place, but weâ€™re very confident that as the inspector general has been doing their work looking at the conduct of the FBI during that period that, by adding their focus to this, that weâ€™ll get to the bottom of it, because the American people have a right to know.â€ Fox News&apos Alex Pappas, Chad Pergram and Meghan Welsh, Fox Business Networkâ€™s Blake Burman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-meets-with-rosenstein-wray-amid-campaign-spying-claims,Russia Investigation,Fox News,

          Tony Podesta's firm is facing scrutiny from the Robert Mueller probe.
           (Facebook) Tony Podesta, the older brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and co-founder of the onetime lobbying powerhouse the Podesta Group, was thrust back into the political spotlight after President Donald Trump pointedly questioned why he had not been ""charged and arrested."" Trump focused on Podesta in one of a series of tweets Sunday attacking Special Counsel Robert Mueller&aposs investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In October,  reports emerged  that Mueller was investigating the Podesta Group over its lobbying work on behalf of a nonprofit group called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine (ECMU). According to the special counsel&aposs indictment of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and associate Rick Gates, the Brussels-based ECMU functioned as a ""mouthpiece"" for Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine&aposs pro-Russian president between 2010 and 2014. The indictment went on to allege that Manafort and Gates enlisted the Podesta Group and one other firm to lobby on behalf of the ECMU -- the ""nominal client,"" in the words of the indictment -- so that Manafort and Gates could continue their work on Yanukovych&aposs behalf without making the required legal disclosures to the Justice Department. The indictment alleged that the Podesta Group was not paid directly by the ECMU, but rather through offshore bank accounts controlled by Manafort and Gates. It also claimed that Gates gave the Podesta Group false talking points in order to cover his and Manafort&aposs tracks about their work for Yanukovych and ECMU. Video Manafort is facing charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent and false statements related to his political work in Ukraine and loans he took out to purchase U.S. properties. Gates has pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges and making false statements and is cooperating with Mueller&aposs investigation. According to the Center for Responsive Politics , the ECMU paid the Podesta Group $1.02 million over 2012 and 2013 for its work. Tony Podesta&aposs name is not mentioned in the indictments of Manafort and Gates and it is not clear what, if anything, he knew about their work for the ECMU and Yanukovych. However, former Podesta Group staffers  told ABC News  they were skeptical about their prospective client. ""There was a lot of suspicion that it was a front for bad stuff,"" one ex-staffer said. Another said workers were concerned Podesta was bringing in ""clients you wouldnâ€™t want to touch with a 100-foot pole."" The Wall Street Journal reported  last month that Podesta was doing $5 million in overseas business by 2015, double what it had been four years earlier. According to the paper, some of those clients included the governments of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and South Sudan. Video That time frame coincided with Podesta&aposs divorce from his second wife, Heather. The Journal reported he gave up ""nearly $5 million in retirement savings"" and agreed to pay his ex-wife $200,000 quarterly over five years. The same day that Manafort and Gates&apos indictment went public, Oct. 30, Tony Podesta announced that he would step away from the firm. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Podesta Group&aposs lobbying income had plummeted from a high of $29.3 million in 2010 at the height of the Obama presidency. In 2017, the firm took in $18.4 million, its lowest income since 2008, as clients who hired Podesta in anticipation of a Hillary Clinton presidency melted away. As the Journal reported, the firm&aposs longtime bank had cut ties in the summer of 2016 over its involvement with an American subsidiary of a sanctioned Russian bank. The same week as the Manafort and Gates indictment, the Podesta Group missed a deadline set by its new banker to pony up $655,000 and its line of credit was cut. During that week, Podesta reportedly shot down an idea to use his art collection -- valued in the millions of dollars -- as collateral for a loan. The Podesta Group ceased operations in November of last year. Most of its employees joined a new firm, Cogent Strategies, headed up by Podesta&aposs last CEO, Kimberley Fritts. ABC News reported Sunday that six former employees were interviewed by federal investigators in connection with the Mueller investigation. The Journal reported at the time of those interviews that Podesta offered to have the firm pay their legal fees. Three former associates told ABC Newa they had not been reimbursed.

          Amber Rose weighed in on Kanye West's support of President Trump.
           (Reuters) Amber Rose has weighed in on ex-boyfriend Kanye Westâ€™s controversial comments on President Trump. Rose, in anÂ  interview on The Fallen State , floated a theory about Trump. â€œWhen I first seen Trump on the podium and just kind of like running for president, I was like, &aposOh my God, that is Kanye in a white man&aposs body,&aposâ€ Rose told host Jesse Lee Peterson. â€œI really felt like they have the same personality, like completely the same personality.â€ Rose, 34, said she thinks West â€œappreciates the politics that Trump used in order to get in officeâ€ and added that she thinks Trump told West during their meeting at Trump Tower that he really wants to make a change. â€œI would like to think that Kanye met with Trump, and Trump said, â€˜Look, I seen these people, I knew they were gonna vote for me and I used them to get elected and I can&apost tell nobody that because I want to get a second term, but now that I&aposm in office I really want to make a change,â€™â€ she said. â€œNow, Kanye can&apost snitch on him, he can&apost snitch on himself. So, you know, maybe he&aposs thinking of the greater good of what Trump can do for the country.â€ Rose dated West from 2008 to 2010 and claimed last year in an interview withÂ  Complex that she never cheated Â on him despite Internet rumors and â€œconstant bullying from him.â€ West came out in support of Trump during a wild  Twitter rant last month . He claimed that he shares â€œdragon energyâ€ with the president. â€œYou donâ€™t have to agree with trump but the mob canâ€™t make me not love him,â€ the â€œGood Lifeâ€ rapper tweeted. â€œWe are both dragon energy. He is my brother.â€ He later doubled down on his  support for the president  in a song titled â€œYe vs. the People.â€ Trump backed West in a subsequent tweet, saying â€œThank you Kanye, very cool!â€ Kim Kardashian, Westâ€™s wife, appeared  to back away  from her husbandâ€™s support of Trump, saying that his feelings were â€œHIS opinion.â€ Chance the Rapper, a fellow Chicago hip-hop artist, initially backed West in his support of Trump, but clarified that he was only  showing love for West, not the president . ""No matter how much I may disagree with [West], it&aposs hard for me to watch people talk about someone I love--even if they were justified in doing so,"" Chance wrote.

What are some of the facts and figures behind it? Those who want to see President Trumpâ€™s  border wall  built may get a chance to help fund the project if a recently introduced bill is passed. The legislation, introduced by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., last week, would create a â€œborder wall trust fund.â€ People could donate any amount of money to it, with the funds specifically designated for â€œwhatever it takes to build the wallâ€ -- from supplies to salaries. It would be overseen by the Treasury Department, according to Black. â€œReal immigration reform cannot be achieved without a secure border -- President Trump has been clear about this since day one,â€ Black, a member of the House Budget Committee, said in a statement. â€œThe most important job of the federal government is the safety and security of the American people, and if citizens in our country wish to contribute to this effort, they absolutely should be given the opportunity.â€ In an interview with Fox News, Black said while anyone can donate money to the U.S. Treasury now, this trust fund would ensure donations would specifically go toward the construction of the border wall. â€œI support President Trump in building the wall. Itâ€™s going to take big funds to do that,â€ Black said, adding that she doesnâ€™t believe Congress has done enough in terms of allocating funding for the wall.   Border Wall Trust Fund Act  by  Kaitlyn  on Scribd 
 Black stressed that the trust fund wouldnâ€™t be the first time the government used crowdfunding to complete a project. She said the fund could be patterned after the private donations used to construct the Washington Monument. Created in 1833, the  Washington National Monument Society  fundraised to begin construction of the Washington Monument. The society was given land, raised money and hired architect Robert Mills to design the memorial. However, the group ran out of money, and construction of the memorial was stalled for more than 20 years until Congress took it over, according to  the National Park Service . Corporations, including Target, also paved the way monetarily for restorations to the monument beginning in 1996, according to  the National Park Service . Black, who is running for governor in Tennessee, said sheâ€™s already heard from a number of her constituents who support the idea of a public trust fund. If established, Black said she and her husband would be first to donate. In March, Trump signed  a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill  that included only $1.6 billion for border measures -- much of which is for repairs to already existing fencing. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and the White House said the spending bill provided for 100 miles of border construction; however, it specifically ruled out any new prototypes for the wall such as the ones Trump visited in California earlier this year. RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), blamed Democrats for the lack of border funding, including in the spending package. He told Fox News that Blackâ€™s bill â€œwould provide a unique funding source for the presidentâ€™s signature campaign promise.â€ Heather Douglass, a spokeswoman for Black, told Fox News, ""Weâ€™re hoping to see [the bill] go through to the presidentâ€™s desk.""

This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" May 21, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: In the meantime, our own Martha MacCallum has just wrapped up an interview with the vice president of the United States. And this meeting did in fact come up.  Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With the revelations that our campaign may have been the subject of surveillance by the FBI, the president, I think, is grateful that the Department of Justice is going to have the inspector general look into it and determine and ensure that there was no surveillance done for political purposes against our campaign.  I think it would be very troubling to millions of Americans if that took place. But we&aposre very confident that, as the inspector general has been doing their work, looking at the conduct of the FBI during that period, that, by adding their focus to this, that we will get to the bottom of it, because the American people have a right to know.  (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right, and you have a right to see the full interview the vice president had with Martha MacCallum. You will see that on ""The Story"" at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time, a little less than three hours from now.  In the meanwhile, we have got Arizona Republican Congressman Andy Biggs. He sits on the House Judiciary Committee.  Congressman, good to have you.  Is this individual, in your eyes, a spy?  REP. ANDY BIGGS, Râ€”ARIZONA: Well, if he&aposs not a spy, he&aposs what I call an undercover operative, an undercover agent. A lot of people would call that a spy, yes.  CAVUTO: So if the president is meeting with the FBI director and Rod Rosenstein and he&aposs obviously imploring -- I know this was originally schedule about a week ago, so I will accept that at face value. That it -- would it be proper for him to pound this with them and to recommend the investigation he has at least been tweeting about?  BIGGS: Absolutely, it is.  I think that he may have some other things on his agenda, but I think this revelation that&aposs come out, I think he has to take it home and he has to find out what Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein are going to do about it.  And I quite frankly am -- I&aposm hoping he really -- you called it a powwow. I hope he&aposs putting the pow and the wow into this thing, because he has got to drive it home that we need to know what our agencies were doing to impact the election. And if they&aposre hiring people and embedding them into a campaign political purposes, that is corruption at the highest level, and that needs to be prosecuted.  CAVUTO: Do you think the president should be careful, though, how he frames this in his discussions with Mr. Rosenstein and the FBI director, that it could have the look of trying to exert his own personal influence on the Justice Department, on the FBI?  BIGGS: Well, I think he has to be careful, but we have to remember that these are -- these agencies are within the executive branch.  He`s the head. All things in the executive branch run through him. He needs to make sure that they&aposre running independent. But if we&aposre going to an inspector general or we should do maybe a second special counsel, that moves to independence. And that`s what needs to happen.  Of course, he can&apost get in there and tell them how to conduct their investigation. But he&aposs now become a victim, and he&aposs a chance -- he has a right to come to these guys and say, look, I was victimized, it looks like. You need to find that out.  CAVUTO: So, if the ongoing inspector general is looking into all these other matters, world there be any harm in just adding this to those matters, in other words, not getting a separate investigation going, but adding it to what he&aposs already looking at?  BIGGS: Well, the only problem that I see with that is, at some point, they run out of time, they run out of time energy and hands that can do all the work.  And this -- you just keep adding on to this. This has become one of the most complex things I have seen, where you drip out. Almost every week, there&aposs something new.  I think a completely independent counsel should be looking at what the Democrats did to get involved in this. I think they need to also look at what happened here with what the FBI and the DOJ did. I just don&apost think that the inspector general needs to add this to his load right now.  CAVUTO: All right, Congressman, thank you for taking the time into your schedule to join us. I appreciate it, sir.  BIGGS: Thanks, Neil.  Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.   Copyright CQ-2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

DEVIN NUNES, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: If they ran a spy ring or an informant ring and they were paying people within the Trump campaign, if any of that is true, that is an absolute redline.  REP. ADAM SCHIFF, RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: This claim by the president, suggestion by Giuliani that there is a political spy embedded in the Trump campaign is nonsense.  VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The president I think is grateful that the Department of Justice is going to have the inspector general look into it and determine and ensure that there was no surveillance done for political purposes against our campaign.  (END VIDEO CLIPS) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: This is the talk. What is the deal with this investigation? The president saying these reports of a spy, an informant inside his campaign, he wants to get to the bottom of it. Today meeting with the FBI director, the deputy attorney general, and deputy director of national intelligence, Dan Coats. We don&apost know exactly what was in the meaning but we were told that he was talking about this. The DOJ put out a statement saying +ACI- The Department has asked the inspector general to expand the ongoing review of the FISA application process to include determining whether there was impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation in persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election. As always the inspector general will consult the appropriate U.S. attorney if there&aposs any evidence of potential criminal conduct. Rosenstein saying with his own statement, saying +ACI-If anyone did infiltrate our surveil participants in the presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action. So with that, let&aposs bring in our panel from Washington, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at national review, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com.  Jonah, this seemed to pick up steam and obviously was fueled by the president&aposs tweet about all of this ongoing. The fact that the inspector general is now taking this, what do you think that tells us?  JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: I think it tells us there&aposs credible reason to take a harder look at what was going on in 2016 in terms of the investigation of the Trump campaign. At the same time, I think the talk about this guy as far as what we know about a spy embedded with the campaign is hyperbole. Having three conversations with people about their contacts with Russia than we know about is not an embedded spy. Maybe it&aposs an informant but it&aposs not quite what people are making it out to be. I think the keyword or the key phrase in Rosenstein statement was +ACI-for any inappropriate purpose. I think there is ample reason that they maybe should&aposve looked into Russian collusion or suspicion of it. But if there was other reasons why they were doing it, if they were trying to undo or hurt President Trump or if there is reason to believe there was political motivation, that would be very bad and it&aposs worth looking into.  BAIER: Katie, your thoughts on all this as it&aposs developing?  KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: It&aposs a good thing the Justice Department is willing to look at this further. But bumping it over to the inspector general is prudent given that the people involved in potential misuse or abuse of power during the 2016 election are still working inside the Justice Department or at the FBI. The inspector general doesn&apost have jurisdiction to interview political employees who worked in the Obama administration who may now be gone.  And I would get back to all the noise surrounding the issue comes down to what launched the special coastal of the first place, whether there were legal instances of authority being abused in the 2016 campaign for political purposes. And the question is, you look at when the investigation happened, after the Hillary Clinton campaign investigation wrapped up, then the Trump campaign was allegedly getting -- and informant was giving information to the FBI. If it was really just about Russian surveillance and interference in the election, then why did the investigation started earlier in 2015 when the Obama administration knew about Russia&aposs plans to meddle in our elections.  BAIER: Here is Devin Nunes, A.B., talking about trying to get the documentation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NUNES: All we are asking for is give us the documentation that you used to start this investigation. We are trying to get to the bottom of what else was used in that FISA because you have many people in the Department of Justice who are claiming that we are wrong. So if we are wrong, show us the information.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: We are told a judge has received that but Capitol Hill has not.  A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Bret, this is a big battle about separation of powers and what congressional investigators can do in their oversight roles to force documents from the Department of Justice and which documents, after Rod Rosenstein has given many, many, many documents, he is resisting providing these Republican members of the house on the Intel committee. Basically this is a struggle to define what is within the purview of oversights and what is overreach.  I have spoken to people who have their concerns about how the FBI might&aposve conducted the Hillary Clinton investigation but still say you can&apost share raw intelligence from an investigation that could be provided to the witnesses.  So today you had DNI, you had FBI, everyone huddling with President Trump, and Rudy Giuliani who is on a P.R. campaign demanding that he can&apost sit for an interview with the special counsel unless we know about other witnesses that were revealed in a New York Times story this weekend who have met with Don Jr. You can&apost demand that you be given information on a witness in exchange for talking to the special counsel. He says the meeting today in which the demands for these documents are being made and reiterated by the president, he was doing that in his capacity not as a subject of the Mueller investigation but as president of the United States to make sure that Congress is getting what they need from the executive branch. So they are doing a really, really good job of muddying and this P.R. campaign of what is and isn&apost allowed and what is and isn&apost appropriate. And that&aposs a huge battle that&aposs drawing out on both sides, but the president and Rudy Giuliani and Devin Nunes are trying to make it appear that congressional oversight, members of Congress have the right to every single document. And the truth is that they don&apost.  BAIER: OK. We will continue to follow, obviously, all sides, both sides of the investigation. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Just because sheâ€™s a woman, Bee shouldnâ€™t get a pass on using a term that has long been used to demean and insult women, characterizing us as stupid sex objects. ""If Bee had directed such vulgar insults at the female members of the Obama family Iâ€™d condemn them as well. Every woman â€“ and man, for that matter â€“ should. But why is it perfectly OK to throw the same insult at Ivanka Trump?"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called on TBS and Time Warner (the parent company of TBS as well as CNN) on Thursday to take action,  saying : â€œThe language used by Samantha Bee last night is vile and vicious. The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling.â€ How should TBS handle Samantha Bee's Ivanka Trump remark? New reaction to late night host Samantha Bee using extremely vulgar term to describe Ivanka Trump; 'Outnumbered' panel debates. Sanders added of Bee: â€œHer disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network.â€ What prompted Beeâ€™s vulgar attack? Ivanka Trump had tweeted out a photo of herself with her young son. As if no mother had ever proudly shared a photo of her beloved child with others.Â   Bee said on her show: â€œYou know, Ivanka, thatâ€™s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dadâ€™s immigration practices, you feckless c---!â€ Only Bee used the full word. And then, to pile on even more vulgarity, Bee said, addressing Ivanka: â€œHe (the president) listens to you! Put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to f------ stop it.â€ And she used the full obscene word, uncensored, here as well. This was another convenient opportunity for Bee to attack the current law thatâ€™s made headlines recently allowing immigrant kids brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents to be separated from their parents at the border. I donâ€™t recall Beeâ€™s outrage at the law when President Obama was in office, nor do I recall her making obscene sexist comments about Michelle Obama or the two Obama daughters at the time. Samantha Bee slams Ivanka Trump Late night talk show host uses vulgar term to slam Ivanka Trump. Howard Kurtz also weighs in on Trump's demand for an apology from the Disney CEO. If Bee had directed such vulgar insults at the female members of the Obama family Iâ€™d condemn them as well. Every woman â€“ and man, for that matter â€“ should. But why is it perfectly OK to throw the same insult at Ivanka Trump? Nor did Bee have any harsh words for the last administration when Democrats mistakenly  tweeted out photos  of children being kept in cages at the border, thinking they were current photos, only to realize they were from President Obamaâ€™s time in office. However, when Bee saw an opportunity she gladly took the chance to go after Ivanka Trump over a sweet mother and son moment captured on camera, proving there is no gutter too filthy for her to venture into. What a difference in how Roseanne Barr â€“ a supporter of President Trump â€“ was treated for an inexcusable racist insult directed at another woman. It took ABC only hours to make the call to cancel Barrâ€™s hit show after she tweeted about Valerie Jarrett, using Jarrettâ€™s initials: â€œmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.â€ So why is there is no indication from TBS now that Samantha Beeâ€™s job is in jeopardy? While not firing Bee, TBS  issued a statement  after her apology Thursday saying: â€œSamantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired. It was our mistake too, and we regret it.â€ Barrâ€™s tweet triggered outrage â€“ as it should have â€“ butÂ there wasÂ less outrage to be heard about Bee&aposs use ofÂ the vile, most disgusting word you can use to describe a woman, by someone who would describe herself as a feminist. Why? Where are all the voices of so-called female empowerment coming to Ivankaâ€™s defense? Will the ladies on â€œThe Viewâ€ call out Bee for her vulgarity and defend Ivanka? Imagine their outrage if one of them had been called a â€œfeckless c---â€ on national television. Will we see House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., condemn Beeâ€™s use of filthy language against another woman? Will the Hollywood feminists whoâ€™ve fed us a nearly daily dose of their â€œresistâ€ movement, resist Bee and call on TBS to cancel â€œFull Frontal?â€ If you have to think about that, then you havenâ€™t been paying attention. This is a new day and there are new rules we supposedly have to play by, and none of them have anything to do with doing the right thing. If youâ€™re an anti-Trump zealot, youâ€™re almost always guaranteed freedom of consequences for your speech. No matter how vile, filthy or disgusting. Sexism is perfectly fine, as long as the target is a Republican woman. Itâ€™s doubtful that Time Warner and TBS will fire Bee and send the same message that was sent by the industry when Barr was fired. The double standard in this game of how low can you go is alarming.

Trump issued an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) to Dinesh Dâ€™Souza, an accomplished author, lecturer, and scholar,"" said a statement from White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. ""Mr. Dâ€™Souza was, in the Presidentâ€™s opinion, a victim of selective prosecution for violations of campaign finance laws.Â  Mr. Dâ€™Souza accepted responsibility for his actions, and also completed community service by teaching English to citizens and immigrants seeking citizenship."" She added: ""In light of these facts, the President has determined that Mr. Dâ€™Souza is fully worthy of this pardon."" Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted: â€œWill be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh Dâ€™Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!â€ D&aposSouza told Fox News he received a call from the president on Wednesday to notify him of the decision. ""I am thrilled and relieved and elated and as an immigrant in America, my American dream has been under something of a cloud, so I&aposm very relieved to have that cloud lifted,"" D&aposSouza told Fox News on Thursday. D&aposSouza said he and Trump spoke for about 10 minutes, calling it a ""very pleasant and very exciting call."" ""President Trump told me he felt I had been treated very unfairly and he felt that I was an important voice for America,"" D&aposSouza said. ""He wanted to clean my record and adhere to continue doing what I&aposm doing."" D&aposSouza tweeted later Thursday that ""Obama & his stooges tried to extinguish my American dream,"" while thanking Trump. The conservative filmmaker had pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine. Despite his guilty plea, Dâ€™Souza and his allies have claimed for years that he was unfairly singled out for prosecution, and unfairly treated by the Obama administration. D&aposSouza in 2012 made a hit anti-Obama documentary called â€œ2016: Obamaâ€™s America.â€ The film examined then-President Obamaâ€™s past and early influences that may have shaped his political ideology. Dâ€™Souzaâ€™s 2014 indictment was announced by then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who was appointed by Obama and fired in 2017 by Trump. The indictment stated that Dâ€™Souza was charged with one count of illegally donating to a Senate campaign and one count of causing false statements to be made to authorities in connection with the contributions. Dâ€™Souzaâ€™s illegal campaign contribution was made in 2012 to Longâ€™s U.S. Senate campaign. Dâ€™Souza pleaded guilty to using a â€œstraw donorâ€ to make the donation. A straw donor is a person who illegally uses another personâ€™s finances to make a political contribution in their own name. Straw donor schemes are illegal under U.S. law, which states that no person should knowingly permit their name to be used to â€œeffect such a contributionâ€ and no person â€œshall knowingly acceptâ€ a contribution made by â€œone person in the name of another person.â€ Dâ€™Souza allegedly coordinated donations to Longâ€™s campaign through friends and acquaintances.

President Trump blasted what he called a ""Double Standard"" at ABC News on Thursday, questioning why he has not gotten an apology for certain statements and reports about him. â€œIger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!â€ Trump tweeted early Thursday. The presidentâ€™s comments follow the networkâ€™s cancellation of Roseanne Barrâ€™s comeback revival of â€œRoseanne,â€ over her racist tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. The president on Wednesday first put the heat on Disney CEO Bob Iger by contrasting his handling of Barr with Disney and ABC&aposs treatment of his administration. (ABC is owned by Disney.) â€œBob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that â€˜ABC does not tolerate comments like thoseâ€™ made by Roseanne Barr,â€ Trump tweeted Wednesday. â€œGee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didnâ€™t get the call?â€ Barr lost her show after describing Jarrett as like â€œthe muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.â€ Jarrett later said Iger had called her before the network cancelled the show. â€œHe apologized,â€ Jarrett said during an MSNBC appearance. â€œHe said he had zero tolerance for that sort of racist, bigoted comment and he wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling his show and so I appreciate that they did that so swiftly.â€ The president on Thursday, though, contrasted that against the handling of ABC&aposs Brian Ross, who was suspended for four weeks in 2017 without pay following a botched â€œexclusiveâ€ about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. He has since returned to air. ABC News did, however, apologize -- just not to Trump directly. â€œWe deeply regret and apologize for the serious error we made yesterday,â€ an ABC News statement read at the time. â€œThe reporting conveyed by Brian Ross during the special report had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process. As a result of our continued reporting over the next several hours ultimately we determined the information was wrong and we corrected the mistake on air and online.â€ White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Trump also wants to know why Iger hasnâ€™t apologized for the â€œhorrible thingsâ€ said by anti-Trump personalities like Keith Olbermann, Jemele Hill, Joy Behar and Kathy Griffin.

Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) discusses President Trumpâ€™s tweet about where Barack Obama was amid reports of an FBI informant in the presidentâ€™s 2016 campaign.

The book, titled ""The World As It Is,"" highlights efforts by Obama&aposs brain trust to reassure him that he would have won re-election if he were allowed to run for a third term. But Obama remained alternately optimistic and dejected, according to Rhodes, who has been feted as anÂ  aspiring novelist-turned national security wunderkind . â€œSometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,â€ Obama told aides,  according to the memoir .Â â€œMaybe we pushed too far. ...

The book also touches on some foreign-policy melodrama as Obama made his exit from the world stage, amid a shifting geopolitical climate that included Brexit and rising disenchantment with globalism.

President Trump fired back Thursday at reports that ousted FBI official Andrew McCabe wrote a secret memo suggesting the president had linked James Comey&aposs firing to the Russia investigation. The memo was first revealed by The New York Times on Wednesday. A source confirmed to Fox News that the memo described a meeting where Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein claimed Trump had asked him to reference Russia in his recommendation to fire Comey. Rosenstein declined, and instead focused on Comey&aposs handling of the Clinton email probe. Trump pushed back on Thursday. â€œNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!â€ Trump tweeted. A source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News that Trump just wanted Rosenstein to mention that Comey told him he was not under investigation in the Russia case. But McCabe&aposs memo reportedly has been turned over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose team is looking at whether Trump tried to obstruct justice. Fox News is told that Mueller&aposs team also has a copy of a draft letter written by Trump on Comey&aposs firing -- Rosenstein originally gave that draft to McCabe. The president ultimately fired Comey on May 9, 2017, linked to a recommendation by Rosenstein criticizing the directorâ€™s handling of the Clinton email investigation. SECRET MCCABE MEMO IN MUELLER&aposS HANDS GIVE DETAILS OF COMEY&aposS FIRING: REPORTÂ  Rosenstein, over a week later, appointed Mueller to investigate Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election. Rosenstein was left leading the Russia probe for the Justice Department following Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ€™ recusal -- a decision causing immense friction between the attorney general and the president to this day. The president said this week that he wished he appointed a different attorney general. Video Sessions, though, did fire McCabe in March, stating that he â€œmade an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candorâ€”including under oathâ€”on multiple occasions.â€ That decision came as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz determined McCabe authorized the leak to the media, but later told investigators he did not know who was responsible. McCabe reportedly kept personal notes on his interactions with Trump, some of which included what Comey told him about his encounters with the president,  Fox News Â reported. The president, though, has denied McCabe ever took notes when meeting with him. â€œSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I donâ€™t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?â€ Trump tweeted in March, following McCabeâ€™s firing. Also on Thursday, the president blasted the mainstream media for their reporting on the FBI informant who had communicated with members of the Trump campaign during the election. The informant communicated with Trump campaign advisers George Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Sam Clovis. â€œThe corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?â€ Trump tweeted. The president has dubbed the revelations of the FBI informant as â€œSPYGATEâ€ and called it â€œone of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history.â€ Democratic lawmakers and former Obama intelligence officials have rejected that description.

31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Andrew Napolitano,Judge Andrew Napolitano: Is the investigation of President Trump legitimate?,"close Video Napolitano: Is the Investigation of Pres Trump Legitimate? Judge Andrew Napolitano asks and answers: Is the Investigation of President Trump Legitimate? This past weekend, President Donald Trump and the most visible member of his legal team, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, fired up their campaign against special counsel Robert Mueller. They attacked people at the Department of Justice whom Trump appointed. They smeared career DOJ lawyers and FBI agents by offering allegations without showing any supporting evidence. And they purported to challenge the legitimacy of Mueller&aposs office itself. The legitimacy question is an opinion Giuliani offered six times to my colleague Bill Hemmer on ""Fox News Sunday."" Surely, Giuliani is entitled to any opinion on any matter, but he must know that his illegitimacy opinion is baseless. Mueller&aposs work, though a constant irritant to Trump, is quite legitimate. It is authorized by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which were approved by Congress. It was created by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. It has been ratified by six different federal judges. The president himself has even accepted the legitimacy of some of Mueller&aposs work. Trump unilaterally imposed financial sanctions on the Russian intelligence agents whom one of Mueller&aposs grand juries indicted for computer hacking and other crimes allegedly committed during the 2016 election. The recent claim by Trump and Giuliani that the investigatory process is rigged against Trump betrays insincerity by Giuliani and an effort to gin up the base by Trump. From his years as a federal prosecutor, Giuliani knows the prosecutorial mindset. It is not one of patiently examining law and facts to ascertain guilt or innocence. That is the judicial mindset. Prosecutors target folks they believe are guilty and then look for enough lawfully acquired evidence to prove guilt. That is a legitimate use of government assets -- a use geared to charging defendants, not evaluating their moral worth for high office. One of the tools available to prosecutors -- and often used in white-collar cases -- is to dispatch a friendly person to chat with those at the periphery of an investigation to see whether any spoken words can lead prosecutors to credible evidence. This process of using an informant to gather evidence is so stunningly normal that it ought not even be of note. That&aposs often how criminal investigations of nonviolent crimes begin -- with conversations between intermediaries who spill the beans. One of the most successful practitioners of this technique was a U.S. attorney in Manhattan named Rudy Giuliani. Today, as the spokesman for Trump&aposs defense team, Giuliani is condemning this process he once perfected -- a process he knows to be lawful -- and he is doing this by calling the intermediary not an informant but a spy. Calling an informant a spy depends on where you sit. When he is your guy, he&aposs an informant. When he is the other side&aposs guy, he&aposs a spy. The Giuliani claim -- unsupported by any public evidence -- is that the Obama administration sent an unnamed FBI undercover agent to inveigle the inner circle of the Trump campaign. If this is true and if it was done without a search warrant, it was a monumental violation of the civil rights of Trump campaign officials, including those of the man who would become the president. But Giuliani has shown no evidence for this. How did we get here? All of this spying and informing -- this mishmash of law enforcement and intelligence gathering -- is today the byproduct of the federal government&aposs post-9/11 mentality. Before 9/11, the CIA gathered intelligence from outside the U.S., and the National Security Agency gathered intelligence from inside the U.S. The FBI constitutionally, for the most part, gathered evidence of crimes. Pre-9/11, the intelligence community and the law enforcement community were prohibited from communicating with each other, for well-grounded historical and practical reasons. Because the intelligence community uses unconstitutional and often unlawful means to acquire data and because law enforcement must use constitutional and lawful means to acquire evidence for a court not to suppress it, they did not exchange notes. But pursuant to the commands of the wildly unconstitutional Patriot Act (six federal judges have held portions of it unconstitutional), the intelligence community and law enforcement began blending their work. FBI agents soon realized that by portraying their work as intelligence gathering and not emphasizing the law enforcement aspects, they could go to a different court -- the FISA court, with its unconstitutionally low bar for obtaining a search warrant (namely, probable cause of speaking to a foreign person) -- to get search warrants. This proved far easier than obtaining a constitutional search warrant, which requires probable cause of a crime. An easier warrant means less work. That was a temptation too great to resist. The intelligence community soon realized it could share with law enforcement what it found by spying on Americans, in return for law enforcement&aposs looking the other way at the lawlessness of domestic spying. All of this produced a cowboy culture of utter disregard for constitutional norms in much of federal law enforcement and domestic intelligence gathering. This is a form of corruption -- the knowing governmental violation of constitutional norms and the intentional toleration of it, set below the radar. Now back to Trump and Giuliani. If they are successful, they will have assaulted the rule of law by persuading the public to accept innuendo and known untruths. I am often on the side of the individual against the government, but if legitimate law enforcement has been or is undermined for political purposes, whether by President Barack Obama in 2016 or by President Trump in 2018, all of us will suffer from more corruption. Giuliani&aposs job is not to be Trump&aposs lawyer; rather, it is to effect public sentiment. For the government, as Abraham Lincoln once said, with public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed. Trump and Giuliani understand that better than they understand the rule of law.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-is-the-investigation-of-president-trump-legitimate,OPINION,Fox News,

Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah told Fox News that the ad is â€œnothing short of reprehensible,â€ while calling on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to denounce the â€œabhorrentâ€ message. A Pelosi spokesman said in response: ""While the Leader does not condone the end of this ad, if the President wants to join in raising the level of civility in politics he should begin with himself."" The ad was put up by Virginia Democratic House candidate Dan Helmer. â€œAfter 9/11, the greatest threat to our democracy lived in a cave. Today, he lives in the White House,â€ Helmer, who is challenging incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, says in the ad. In the video, an image of bin Laden is shown before the camera pans to the White House and Trump. DEM CANDIDATE COMPARES TRUMP TO BIN LADEN IN NEW CAMPAIGN AD â€œNo one, not even the president, is above the law,â€ he continues. On his campaign website, Helmer says he and his wife â€œwere shocked by the 2016 elections and alarmed at the actions of this Administration and Congress.â€ Comstock, meanwhile, called Helmer&aposs ad ""outrageous,"" prompting Helmer to fire back at Comstock. Helmer, who says heâ€™s â€œdifferentâ€ and â€œnot a politicianâ€ in the spot, released another ad earlier this month that showed him buying a rifle at a gun show without having to complete a background check. Federal background checks are required in order for someone to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer; private sales are not subjected to background checks.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-blasts-reprehensible-dem-ad-comparing-trump-to-bin-laden,White House,Fox News,
31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Chris Stirewalt,One crazy summer for Trump and Mueller,"close Video Trump claims Mueller will meddle in midterms Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano comments in on 'Fox & Friends First.' **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign upÂ  here .**   On the roster:   One crazy summer for Trump and Mueller - Time Out:Â Bring on the Dubble Bubble - South Dakota gubernatorial race is a toss-up - Trump admin plans to proceed with tariffs - A story youâ€™ll relish Â   ONE CRAZY SUMMER FOR TRUMP AND MUELLER Â   The good news, America, is that we are in the closing weeks of the probe into Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.Â   The bad news is that things are likely to get crazier and uglier every minute closer we get to the end.Â   We should point out that we donâ€™t particularly pay attention to individual theories of the case. We will leave the shadowboxing to others. Our interest is in how matters will affect the fall elections and the 2020 contests thereafter. With that in mind, letâ€™s batch through some of the news that has been breaking on this front.Â   -Â President Trump Â is limbering up his pardon pen. Trump raised eyebrows last summer with his pardon of a former Arizona sheriff who was facing contempt charges for refusing to comply with court orders. The sheriff, though, had been a stalwart for Trump during not just the 2016 campaign but also during Trumpâ€™s effort to convince Americans that then- President Obama Â was a secret Kenyan and usurper of the Oval Office. Now, Trump is preparing to pardonÂ  Dinesh Dâ€™Souza , who pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud in a New York Senate election. Dâ€™Souza, for the uninitiated, is an all-star Twitter troll with a robust following among theÂ  Rosanne Barr Â set. Trump is also said to be considering pardons for the ultra-corrupt former governor of Illinois,Â  Rod Blagojevich , and lifestyle guruÂ  Martha Stewart . While Stewartâ€™s case is rather different in that she may really have been steamrolled, what ties the three together is that in each instance, the potential recipients blame figures common to the probe into potential wrongdoing in Trumpâ€™s campaign, particularlyÂ  James Comey . This is probably just setting the table for what we expect to be the pardons of Trump intimates now or potentially facing federal charges. -Â  Do you know any of those people who just send you email calendar invites to meetings you havenâ€™t agreed to? This is kind of the approach that Trumpâ€™s lawyerÂ  Rudy GiulianiÂ  is taking with Special CounselÂ  Robert Mueller . Mueller canâ€™t close his investigation until he interviews the president, but Giuliani says that canâ€™t happen until late June at the earliest because Trump is too busy preparing for a potential summit with North Korean dictatorÂ  Kim Jong Un Â to get ready to meet with Mueller. Giuliani also says that Mueller told him that if the interview happens soon that the whole investigation can be concluded byÂ Sept. 1, an assertion that Muellerâ€™s team hasnâ€™t knocked down. Now, Giuliani says that the matterÂ  mustÂ  conclude byÂ Sept. 1Â or it will amount to prosecutorial interference with the midterm elections in the same way that former FBI DirectorÂ  James ComeyÂ  helped tankÂ  Hillary Clinton â€™s bid with an October surprise about her emails that turned out to be a fizzle. Oh yeah, Giuliani also says Trump wonâ€™t talk to Mueller until the prosecutor turns overÂ  everythingÂ  in his case file for review. But other than that, heâ€™s ready to get â€˜er doneâ€¦ -Â  The Trump team continues to read out of the Clinton playbook for dealing with the Mueller investigation. One of the key strategies is to enforce strict partisan discipline. Witness the comments from Rep.Â  Trey Gowdy , R-S.C., who sought to reassure Americans that the FBI had not become the Stasi as Trumpâ€™s frothiest defenders claim. Team Trump is coming hard after Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, for â€œdrinking the Kool Aidâ€ and suggesting that he was soft on Hillary Clinton in his interrogation over her role in the Benghazi debacle. Some of the presidentâ€™s defenders are even suggesting Gowdy is a liar because the key documents may not have been present at a briefing. What makes it all so funny is that Gowdy has been the one having to hold the hand of Mueller foe Intelligence Committee ChairmanÂ  Devin Nunes , who apparently doesnâ€™t want to or isnâ€™t able to read certain classified documents. Itâ€™s important for Team Trump to keep supporters focused on their enemies â€“ Obama, Clinton, Comey â€“ but even more important to punish members of the tribe who dissent from the party line. -Â  Do you remember when Republicans used to complain so loudly about the way then-President ObamaÂ reflexively blamed his predecessor,Â  George W. Bush ? AsÂ  Fred Barnes Â  rightly observed Â in May 2009 â€œTrue, presidents have blamed the prior administration for problems they inherit,Â but I can&apost think of a president who did so as aggressively and with such moral preening as Obama.â€ Fred was right. It was unbecoming, unhelpful and divisive. So what are we to think about an administration even more obsessed with its predecessor? Imagine if Obama had opened new investigations into the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the handling of Hurricane Katrina or the Panic of 2008. All would have been merited by facts, supported by facts in evidence and enormously pleasing to Obamaâ€™s base. -Â  IfÂ President TrumpÂ doesnâ€™t feel like he can get away with firing Attorney GeneralÂ  Jeff Sessions Â why doesnâ€™t he leave the poor guy alone? Trump insiders say in piece after piece about the presidentâ€™s abuse of his top cop that firing Sessions is impossible because it would bring â€œpolitical consequences.â€ Now, we will allow that in the current climate it would be hard to get an attorney general nominee through the Senate. To get someone through, the nominee would have to show sufficient independence and skepticism to be confirmed that he or she would offer no relief to a president who seems to want an umpire who calls them for the home team. So we ask you quite sincerely: Is there some point to theÂ  ongoing humiliations Â of Sessions? The AG has made it clear that heâ€™s not going to be bullied out, so why not leave him be? After all, Sessions continues to score policy victories for the administration. We hope that thereâ€™s some purpose here â€“ even a cynical one â€“ because otherwise itâ€™s just pure sadism.   -Â  Each Thursday we pass along the columns of our friend JudgeÂ Andrew Napolitano. We know that some of you chafe at his libertarianism, but also know how much you appreciate his faithful reading of law, devotion to Madisonian precepts and willingness to tell the truth even when it goes against his own stated interests. We would suggest thatÂ  this weekâ€™s installment Â of what we call â€œThe Judgeâ€™s Rulingâ€ is particularly useful for Republicans trying to separate their feelings from facts as it relates to the Mueller probe:Â â€œIf [Trump and Giuliani] are successful, they will have assaulted the rule of law by persuading the public to accept innuendo and known untruths. â€¦ Giuliani&aposs job is not to be Trump&aposs lawyer; rather, it is to effect public sentiment. For the government, as Abraham Lincoln once said, with public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed. Trump and Giuliani understand that better than they understand the rule of law.â€ THE RULEBOOK: HE TOLD US  â€œI am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness.â€ â€“  Alexander Hamilton ,  Federalist No. 1 TIME OUT: Â  BRING ON THE DUBBLE BUBBLE New Yorker:  â€œFor too long, we have asked one another, typically as an insult, â€˜Can you chew gum and walk at the same time?â€™ A better question might be, â€˜Why arenâ€™t you chewing gum and walking right now?â€™ Thatâ€™s the apparent takeaway of a study that was presented this week at the European Congress on Obesity, in Vienna, Austria, and which appears in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science. The researchers, led by the sports scientist  Yuka Hamada , of Waseda University, in Japan, found that people who chew gum while walking expend more energy than non-chewing walkers. â€¦ The authors noted that, if you did nothing but chew gum all day for a year, you could lose eleven pounds. â€˜Its potential effect on energy balance should not be discounted,â€™ they wrote. â€¦ Unlike most gum-chewing studies, Hamadaâ€™s looked at people in motion rather than at rest. â€¦ They conclude that â€˜gum chewing during walking may increase the physical and physiological functions of middle-aged and elderly male participants in particular.â€™â€  Flag on the play? - Â Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM Â with your tips, comments or questions.

In a survey of 625 registered Republican voters likely to cast their ballots in the election, 45 percent said they would vote for  Kristi Noem  if the race were held today. Forty-four percent, meanwhile, said they&aposd vote for  Marty Jackley . Another 11 percent said they were undecided. Jacksonville, Florida-based Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy polled voters by telephone between May 21 and May 23. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. The numbers illustrate what those closely watching the race have known for a while: it&aposs close. And with one week until the primary, candidates have a tight window to win over voters still on the fence or steal support from their competitor. Both campaigns seemed keenly aware of the tight nature of the race. In the days ahead of the primary, they took digs at one another in interviews with the Argus Leader and in television and radio ads that began airing over the weekend.â€  No special Senate election in Arizona this year -Â  KNXV : â€œA key deadline quietly passed overnight, with huge political implications in Arizona and across the country. SenatorÂ  John McCain â€™s seat will officially not be up for grabs this November. That deadline passed at midnight and itâ€™s important for several reasons, especially for Republicans who are fighting to keep control in the Senate in the upcoming November mid-terms.Â Sen. McCain is battling brain cancerÂ and hasnâ€™t returned to Washington in months. Arizona GovernorÂ  Doug Ducey â€™s office confirmed that he and First LadyÂ  Angela Ducey Â met with the McCains near Sedona on Tuesday. Since the midnight deadline passed, DuceyÂ would appoint someone to McCainâ€™s seat should he step down.Â â€¦Â Should the senator decide to step down now, some of the names being talked about to replace him are his wife,Â  Cindy McCain , but also former Attorney GeneralÂ  Grant Woods Â and former SenatorÂ  Jon Kyl .â€  All eyes on Montana Senate primary -   Roll Call : â€œThe next big Republican Senate primary is in Montana, where voters will choose Democratic Sen.  Jon Tester â€™s opponent on Tuesday. The GOP contest in Big Sky Country was a sleepy affair for much of this year, lacking the verbal ax throwing that animated similar contests in Indiana and West Virginia this spring. â€˜It kinda starts late in Montana, it always does,â€™ said a GOP strategist who works in the state. Not to mention that voters there went through a grueling gubernatorial race in 2016, shortly followed by an expensive special election for the at-large House seat. â€˜Some people just donâ€™t want to pay attention,â€™ the strategist added. More than 130,000 people had voted early as of Tuesday night, and with the June 5 primary inching closer, outside groups have increasingly been saturating the airwaves and candidates have been scrambling to differentiate themselves.â€ Trump endorses Dan Donovan in NY-11 House race -  WashEx : â€œPresident Trump is backing Rep.  Dan Donovan , R-N.Y., in the primary race for New Yorkâ€™s 11 Congressional District against  Michael Grimm , who is running to win his seat back after stepping down in 2015. â€˜There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again,â€™ Trump tweeted Wednesday evening. â€¦ Donovan did not vote for the GOP&aposs tax reform measure that passed in December, citing that the â€˜bill that came out of the conference committee still means a tax increase for many Staten Island and Brooklyn residents.â€™ Earlier this month, Donovan released an ad where he touted how he was working to advance Trumpâ€™s agenda.â€ Gubernatorial candidate in Md. fights to correct ballots after sudden death of running mate -  Baltimore Sun:  â€œMaryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate  Valerie Ervin  has filed a lawsuit seeking to force state officials to reprint primary elections ballots with her name on them. In a filing in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, Ervin and her running mate,  Marisol Johnson , argue that not printing new ballots â€˜will cause confusion and cause voters to reassess who to vote for since their candidate does not appear properly on the ballot.â€™ Ervin had been the lieutenant governor running mate for  Kevin Kamenetz , who was a leading Democratic contender for governor. After Kamenetz died of a sudden cardiac arrest on May 10, Ervin decided to take his place at the top of the ticket, as state law allows. She picked Johnson, a former Baltimore County school board member, to be her running mate.â€ New Mexico gubernatorial candidate made profit off state insurance plan -  Politico:  â€œRep.  Michelle Lujan Grisham , the leading Democratic candidate for governor in New Mexico, profited from the stateâ€™s use of a high-priced health-insurance program for seriously ill patients, even after Obamacare made such programs virtually obsolete. As most states were shuttering their subsidized health-insurance programs for people with pre-existing conditions because they could get coverage through Obamacare, a firm co-founded by Lujan Grisham and a close political ally received millions of dollars to run New Mexicoâ€™s program, even as she served in Congress. The stateâ€™s high risk pool is still open even though its premiums are higher on average than Obamacare â€” 10 percent higher this year â€” and while all but nine of the 35 states that once had such programs either shut them down or cut off new enrollment.â€ Trump in Texas for shooting victims and campaign donors -  Dallas Morning News:  â€œPresident Donald Trump arrived Thursday in Houston and met privately with relatives of students killed at Santa Fe High School two weeks ago, before rubbing elbows with high dollar donors in Houston and Dallas. The trip was scheduled before the May 18 school rampage that left 10 people dead. The president will raise campaign funds for Senate Republicans at a luncheon in Houston before heading to Dallas for a high-dollar dinner to benefit the national party and his own 2020 reelection effort. â€¦ Donors in Dallas will pay at least a $2,700-per-person for a reception at the Adolphus Hotel downtown. VIP tickets for dinner cost $50,000 and include a photo with the president.â€ TRUMP ADMIN PLANS TO PROCEED WITH TARIFFS  WSJ : â€œThe Trump administration, unable to win concessions from European Union counterparts ahead of a Friday deadline, is planning to make good on its threat to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum, people familiar with the matter said. The administration is expected to make an announcement as early as Thursday. The move, which has been threatened for months, is almost certain to draw a response from the EU, which has threatened to retaliate with its own tariffs on such American products as motorcycles, jeans and bourbon. President Donald Trump announced in March global tariffs of 25% on imported steel, and 10% on aluminum, based on national security concerns. The White House delayed implementation for some countries, giving those trading partners a chance to offer concessions to avoid the tariffs. The U.S. is now planning to let the EUâ€™s exemption lapse. One person familiar with the matter said the administrationâ€™s plans could still change, particularly if the two sides are able to cobble together a last-minute deal, though both sides suggest such a deal is unlikely.â€ Mexico to impose tariffs right back at the U.S. -  The Hill:  â€œThe government of Mexico announced on Thursday it would implement new duties on various U.S. products in response to President Trump&aposs decision to levy steel and aluminum tariffs on the country. â€˜Mexico reiterates its position against protectionist measures that affect and distort international commerce in goods,â€™ the government said in a statement. â€˜In response to the tariffs imposed by the United States, Mexico will impose equivalent measures to various products like flat steels (hot and cold foil, including coated and various tubes), lamps, legs and shoulders of pork, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, blueberries, various cheeses, among others, up to an amount comparable to the level of affectation.â€™â€  Beijing official warns China would retaliate against US trade crackdown -   Fox News : â€œChina reserves the right to retaliate if U.S. trade measures against it violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the Chinese commerce ministry said Thursday.  Gao Feng , a Chinese commerce ministry spokesman, said a White House proposal to limit Chinese investment in the U.S. would violate the â€˜rules and basic spiritâ€™ of the WTO. â€˜The Chinese side will carefully evaluate the U.S. measures and reserves the right to take corresponding measures,â€™ Gao said. China believes the two countries have a huge potential for cooperation and does not want to see an escalation of Sino-U.S. trade frictions, Gao told reporters at a regular news briefing, Reuters reported.â€  PLAY-BY-PLAY Boehner: â€˜The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhereâ€™  -  NBC News White House to launch opioid ad push next week  -  Axios McConnellâ€™s reign in the Senate will soon be record-breaking  -  Politico Congress mulls lowering age requirement for truck drivers to prevent national shortage   -  Fox News Trumpâ€™s net worth at the lowest since campaign  -  Bloomberg  AUDIBLE: IT ME   â€œWhy would you need a Republican wannabe if you can have the Republican?â€ â€“  Rep.

31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Brooke Singman,"Trump says heâ€™s considering pardoning Martha Stewart, Rod Blagojevich","close Video Trump considering pardon for Martha Stewart President Trump says he is considering commuting sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. President Trump said Thursday he was considering pardoning or commuting the sentences of Martha Stewart and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, following his announcement earlier in the day of a full pardon for conservative filmmaker Dinesh Dâ€™Souza. The presidentâ€™s comments came during a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One enroute to Houston, Texas. Trump called the former governorâ€™s sentence on corruption charges â€œreally unfairâ€ and added that â€œplenty of other politicians could have said a lot worse.â€ The president said that Blagojevich said something dumb, but that ""lots of politicians"" do. 
      President Trump on Thursday pardoned conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, right. The president said later in the day he would consider pardoning or commuting the sentences of Martha Stewart, center, and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, left.
       (AP) â€œIâ€™ll tell you another one â€¦ thereâ€™s another one that Iâ€™m thinking about. Rod Blagojevich -- 18 years in jail for being stupid and saying things that every other politician, you know that many other politicians say,â€ Trump told reporters. â€œAnd if you look at what he said, he said something to the effect like &aposwhat do I get&apos â€¦ stupid thing to say.â€ The former Democratic governor, who was a contestant on Trump&aposs ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2010, began his 14-year prison sentence in 2012 after being convicted of corruption. Blagojevich&aposs scheduled release date is in 2024. Blagojevich was governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009, when he was impeached and convicted on corruption charges over allegations he took bribes for political appointmentsâ€”including to the open U.S. Senate seat of former President Barack Obama. Trump suggested he was more interested in â€œcurtailing his sentenceâ€ than a full pardon. â€œI am seriously thinking about â€“ not pardoning â€“ but I am seriously thinking of a curtailment of Blagojevich,"" Trump said. The president also said he would consider pardoning Stewart, saying she ""used to be one of my biggest fans."" â€œAnd there are others. I think to a certain extent Martha stewart was harshly and unfairly treated. And she used to be my biggest fan in the world â€¦ before I became a politician,"" Trump said. ""But thatâ€™s ok I donâ€™t view it that way.â€ Stewart was convicted in 2004 of obstructing justice and lying to the government as part of an insider trading case. At the time, former FBI Director James Comey was the federal prosecutor who charged Stewart. The president&aposs comments come after an early morning tweet announcing that he would pardon D&aposSouza. â€œWill be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh Dâ€™Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!â€ the president tweeted Thursday morning. D&aposSouza told Fox News he received a call from the president on Wednesday to notify him of the decision. ""I am thrilled and relieved and elated and as an immigrant in America, my American dream has been under something of a cloud, so I&aposm very relieved to have that cloud lifted,"" D&aposSouza told Fox News on Thursday. D&aposSouza said he and Trump spoke for about 10 minutes, calling it a ""very pleasant and very exciting call."" ""President Trump told me he felt I had been treated very unfairly and he felt that I was an important voice for America,"" D&aposSouza said. ""He wanted to clean my record and adhere to continue doing what I&aposm doing."" The conservative filmmaker had pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine.

31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Associated Press,North Koreans to meet Trump; 'good progress' toward summit,"NEW YORK â€“  A top aide to Kim Jong Un will make a rare visit to Washington Friday to hand a letter from the North Korean leader to President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after reporting ""good progress"" in talks between the two sides to revive an on-again, off-again nuclear summit. ""I am confident we are moving in the right direction,"" Pompeo told reporters at a news conference in New York after meeting Thursday with former North Korean military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol. ""Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste."" He would not say that the summit is a definite go for Singapore on June 12 and could not say if that decision would be made after Trump reads Kim Jong Un&aposs letter. However, his comments were the most positive from any U.S. official since Trump abruptly canceled the meeting last week after belligerent statements from the North. The two countries, eying the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. Early Thursday, Trump told reporters ""we are doing very well"" with North Korea. He added there may even need to be a second or third summit meeting to reach a deal on North Korean denuclearization but still hedged, saying ""maybe we&aposll have none."" Kim Yong Chol is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. in 18 years, and his trip to the White House will be a highly symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year. Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country&aposs leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before."" He tweeted from New York: ""Good progress today during our meetings"" with Kim and his team. Yet he also said at his news conference that difficult work remains including hurdles that may appear to be insurmountable as negotiations progress on the U.S. demand for North Korea&aposs complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. ""We will push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome,"" he said. Pompeo spoke after meeting with Kim Yong Chol for a little more than two hours at the residence of the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The talks had been expected to be held in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon, and had not been expected to conclude until 1:30 p.m. Instead, the two men wrapped up at 11:25 a.m. Pompeo said they finished everything they needed to address in the morning session. Immediately afterward, he tweeted that he had had substantive talks on the priorities for the potential summit. Pompeo was accompanied by Andrew Kim, the head of a CIA unit assigned to work on North Korea, and Mark Lambert, the head of the State Department&aposs Korea desk. ""Our secretary of state is having very good meetings,"" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing on a trip to Texas. He said of the North Koreans, ""I believe they will be coming down to Washington on Friday. A letter being delivered to me from Kim Jong Un. It is very important to them."" ""It is all a process,"" he said of arranging the summit. ""Hopefully we will have a meeting on the 12th."" Despite the upbeat messaging in the United States, Kim Jong Un, in a meeting with Russia&aposs foreign minister on Thursday, complained about the U.S. trying to spread its influence in the region, a comment that may complicate the summit plans. ""As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of U.S. hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,"" Kim told Sergey Lavrov. North Korea&aposs flurry of diplomatic activity following an increase in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and for the international legitimacy a summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether he will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies. Trump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make a nuclear deal, but he has left the world guessing since canceling the meeting last week in an open letter to Kim that complained of the North&aposs ""tremendous anger and open hostility."" North Korea&aposs conciliatory response to that letter appears to have put the summit back on track. Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That was the last time the two sides, which are technically at war, attempted to arrange a leadership summit.

31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,ET Online,Kathy Griffin lashes out against Trump's 'abuse of power' after bloody photo scandal in Twitter essay,"
          Kathy Griffin reflected on her bloody Trump photo controversy from a year ago on Twitter.
           (Reuters) It&aposs been one year since Kathy Griffin faced a barrage of backlash for posing for a photo in which she held a bloody mask that resembled President Donald Trump&aposs decapitated head.  In honor of the anniversary of the biggest controversy of her career, the comedian went on a tweet-storm, sharing many of her thoughts about how she&aposs been treated since the incident. KATHY GRIFFIN REFLECTS ON ANDERSON COOPER FRIENDSHIP ""One year ago today my Trump photo was released,"" Griffin wrote, beginning a series of tweets that number in the double digits. ""I have planned on doing this thread for a while but the fact that Sarah Sanders brought my name up at the podium today makes it even more appropriate for me to share some thoughts on what happened."" Griffin shared a clip from Sander&aposs Wednesday morning White House press briefing in which she referred to Griffin&aposs controversial photo while listing public figures who mocked Trump and have yet to apologize. KATHY GRIFFIN MAKES FIRST RED CARPET APPEARANCE ""I am in a position of tremendous privilege. I have access to resources that allowed me to deal with this in a way others who aren&apost as privileged couldn&apost have. And that&aposs exactly why I&aposm speaking out, I don&apost want this to happen to someone who doesn&apost have my resources,"" she continued. Griffin went on to explain the rationale behind posing for the infamous photo, writing, ""The image was inspired by Trump&aposs sexist comments to Don Lemon about Megyn Kelly from the 2015 campaign."" ""So the mask photo was meant to be a play on those sexist comments about Megyn..&aposblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever..&apos"" Griffin continued. ""The photo shoot for the Trump mask photo was actually for new photographs for my tour/headshots etc. We decided to do the Trump mask shot at the last minute. My assistant went out and bought a $10 dollar halloween mask and ketchup...that&aposs it. This wasn&apost some elaborate setup."" ANDY COHEN REPLACES KATHY GRIFFIN Griffin admitted that she knew the photo would stir up controversy, but that it would be ""a one or two-day thing.""  ""My point was to do something provocative in an attempt to keep the spotlight shining on his sexism,"" she added, explaining that she feels it&aposs the job of comedians to ""shine a bright light on issues people are afraid to talk about, speak truth to power, push boundaries, take risks"" often by being provocative. Griffin also shared a quote Jim Carrey gave exclusively to ET&aposs Leanne Aguilera days after the photo came out, in which he said, ""I think it is the job of a comedian to cross the line at all times, because that line is not real and If you step out into that spotlight and you&aposre doing the crazy things that [Trump is] doing, we&aposre the last line of defense."" However, once the photo was released, ""s--- hit the fan."" ""Death threats started flowing in...critical tweets from Democrats/progressives...nasty tweets from Republicans,"" Griffin recalled. To stem the extremely negative reaction to the pic, Griffin released an emotional apology video, but it didn&apost prevent her from getting thrown into what she calls the ""Trump wood chipper."" Trump tweeted at the time, ""Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!"" ""I learned that day the power of the presidency and the power of the Trump machine. Immediately the death threats started pouring in again but more violent and serious than the previous night,"" she wrote. ""The news networks broke into their programming to put his tweet up."" ""The way I like to look at it is Trump is the most powerful news director and campaign director. A tweet from Obama was just a message..a tweet from Trump is an order to his millions of followers and the news media. And that day I was the target of that order,"" she continued. After condemning the president&aposs use of his powerful influence to target her, Griffin continued to detail the fallout from her photo. ""Venues started to cancel my shows. I don&apost blame them, they were getting bomb threats and threats from donors about pulling funding. I bring this up though to point out a key fact...my shows weren&apost cancelled because ticket holders..my fans..wanted their money back,"" she explained. ""The shows were cancelled because the President of the United States and his family were offended by an image I released and decided to unleash an army on me."" Among her voluminous series of tweets, Griffin reflected on her life over the last year, and how she hasn&apost been ""broken"" or in hiding, as some may have assumed. ""Many people didn&apost know what I was going through in the past year, they assumed I was off enjoying myself and taking time off or that I was broken. They didn&apost realize the abuse of power stuff fully until I started talking about it,"" she wrote. ""The only way to deal with a presidency that abuses power and is authoritarian in nature is to make sure that we back up those that the administration has tried to knock down. It&aposs exhausting but so important if we have any hope of preserving our democracy,"" she concluded.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathy-griffin-lashes-out-against-trumps-abuse-of-power-after-bloody-photo-scandal-in-twitter-essay,Scandal,Fox News,
31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Tim Graham,"Samantha Bee's vile insults against Ivanka Trump, others are liberal mediaâ€™s late-night business model","close Video Host Samantha Bee calls Ivanka Trump 'feckless c---' â€˜Full Frontalâ€™ host Samantha Bee is slammed for calling Ivanka Trump a 'feckless c---' on her show. People who arenâ€™t liberals are confused by what our major media companies think is â€œcomedy.â€ The late-night schedule is packed with angry liberals who vent their spleen and assume everyone finds it hilarious. Often, itâ€™s vicious. On her show â€œFull Frontalâ€ on Wednesday night, TBS ranter Samantha Bee called President Trumpâ€™s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump a â€œfeckless c---â€ and seemed to imply that Ivanka should plead for amnesty for illegal immigrants by seducing her father. Yes, you read that right. Bee backed down from the first part of her insult Thursday afternoon in the wake of a torrent of criticism,  tweeting : â€œI would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.â€ But on Wednesday night, Bee professed outrage that Ivanka Trump posted an adorable photo of herself and her young son as the Trump administration is being attacked for separating illegal immigrant parents from their children. In the comment she apologized for on Thursday, Bee said Wednesday on her show: â€œYou know, Ivanka, thatâ€™s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dadâ€™s immigration practices, you feckless c---!â€ Bee used the full word for the obscene sexist insult. Samantha Bee slams Ivanka Trump Late night talk show host uses vulgar term to slam Ivanka Trump. Howard Kurtz also weighs in on Trump's demand for an apology from the Disney CEO. TBSÂ  issued a statement Â after Beeâ€™s apology Thursday saying: â€œSamantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired. It was our mistake too, and we regret it.â€ But in addition to Beeâ€™s first offensive comment, on â€œFull Frontalâ€ a childhood picture of Ivanka sitting on her fatherâ€™s lap flashed on the screen as Bee seemed to coach her on how to seduce her dad, saying: â€œPut on something tight and low cut and tell your father to f------ stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes. OK?â€ Again, Bee used the full obscenity. Never mind that federal immigration officials were separating immigrant parents and children during the Obama administration. Factually, it was â€œan Obama thing.â€ Bee knew it. Bee added: â€œSo, no, Donald Trump didn&apost invent this issue. He&aposs just making it so much worse. Now everyone who even approaches the border is treated like a criminal.â€ Then Bee mocked the height and integrity of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, figuring she needed to throw out more insults at Republicans: â€œAccording to a haunted marionette, Jeff Sessions, these babies are actually baby criminals.â€ Lines like these are apparently knee-slappers if youâ€™re a bitter Hillary Clinton supporter who finds the bile of â€œFull Frontalâ€ to be as healing as a walk in the woods. But how can any liberal lecture about the decline of our civic discourse and laugh at Bee throwing the C-word? Somehow Bee is the toast of the mainstream media. Following up on this vulgar program, Bee has been selected by the Emmy Awards people to  receive an award Thursday night  that goes to ""outstanding programs that have leveraged the dynamic power of television to inspire social change."" Fortune magazine even came out with a list of 50 â€œGreatest World Leaders,â€ and ludicrously ranked Bee as #19, ahead of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and former vice president Joe Biden. Seriously? Now this is funny. Bee told an interviewer at Wired magazine her show is journalistic: â€œEverythingâ€™s grounded in research and journalism. We have a team of journalists working here, and a fact-checker. We care deeply about facts.â€ Among Beeâ€™s â€œfactualâ€ and â€œresearchedâ€ statements are her 2016 campaign zingers like this one: â€œIowans chose this fish-faced, horse-s---- salesman Ted Cruz as their new prized heifer.â€ Or how about this religiously bigoted shot at Mitt Romney? Bee said that Romney, a Mormon, was â€œsoiling his temple garments at the thought of brokered convention.â€ Then Bee said the Republican National Convention was a â€œrage-a-thonâ€ featuring â€œa parade of hemorrhoidal has-beens.â€ More recently, when House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced he was retiring, Bee declared he was ""f------- horrible"" and a ""f------- coward."" How extraordinarily clever! TBS signed Bee up for two more seasons in January. So Bee apparently doesnâ€™t have to worry about being canned like Roseanne Barr when she sounds intoxicated late at night. Because viciously mocking conservatives apparently isnâ€™t bad for business. In fact, itâ€™s the liberal mediaâ€™s late-night business model.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/samantha-bees-vile-insults-against-ivanka-trump-others-are-liberal-medias-late-night-business-model,OPINION,Fox News,
31/05/2018 00:00,2018,5,31,Howard Kurtz,"Roseanne blames Ambien, ABC, herself as Trump also hits the network","close Video Kurtz: Roseanne fiasco raises question of double standards President Trump accuses ABC of unfair treatment following Bob Iger's apology for Roseanne Barr's racially charged tweet; analysis from Howard Kurtz, Fox News media analyst.
 I think we can all agree it wasnâ€™t the Ambien, that Roseanne Barr has a long history of spewing conspiracy theories and ugly attacks. But her spectacular self-immolation has ignited a cultural debate in this country over race, online venom, cultural standards and â€” inevitably â€” President Trump. Even as Barr, in a late-night tweestorm, blamed her racist slur against Valerie Jarrett on the sleep medication, and attacked some of her fellow cast members, she admitted that she was fully at fault: â€œguys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting -- it was memorial day too -- i went 2 far & do not want it defended -- it was egregious Indefensible.â€ Fine. Sheâ€™s right. There is no defense. What planet do you have to be on to talk about a black person and â€œPlanet of the Apesâ€? There is also no question that ABC knew exactly what it was getting, which is why network president Ben Sherwood told the New York Times back in March that â€œyou canâ€™t control Roseanne Barr. Many who have tried have failed.â€ So obviously the network wasnâ€™t unaware that Barr had a long history of tweeting ugly, unproven insults and wild conspiracy theories. And presumably she wasnâ€™t on Ambien all those times. Roseanne retweeted at one point that â€œABC is allowing the Trump haters to control their stationâ€ â€” even though it was the network that provided the platform for her pro-Trump reboot in the first place. The network gambled that she could revive her hit show â€” which she did, specifically tailored to appeal to Trump Country â€” and she did. But even as she was riding high, Roseanne couldnâ€™t stay off the Twitter. And that cost her, the hundreds of people who worked on the show and the network that invested in her. With so many pundits on the left blaming the Roseanne debacle on Trump â€” who, of course, had nothing to do with it besides enjoying the showâ€™s success â€” it was only a matter of time before the president joined the fray. Itâ€™s noteworthy that Trump made no comment on Barrâ€™s racist tweet. Instead, he tweeted that Disney CEO Bob Iger â€œBob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that â€˜ABC does not tolerate comments like thoseâ€™ made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didnâ€™t get the call?â€ Iâ€™m sure unfair things have been said about Trump on ABC News and every other network. Iâ€™m just as sure that they didnâ€™t fall into the category of likening him to an ape. But HBOâ€™s Bill Maher, five years ago, did jokingly compare Trumpâ€™s hair to an orangutan. And ABCâ€™s lightning-quick dumping of â€œRoseanneâ€ does raise questions about the media and cultural standards used when public personalities say offensive things. No action was taken against Joy Behar, for instance, when the â€œViewâ€ co-host mocked Vice President Penceâ€™s religion. She eventually apologized, first privately and then publicly. MSNBC took no action against Joy Reid when a torrent of her homophobic tweets surfaced from a decade ago. She ludicrously claimed that her account had been hacked, but also apologized for her â€œdumbâ€ and â€œhatefulâ€ postings. And ESPN action took no action against former â€œSports Centerâ€ co-host Jemele Hill for calling the president a â€œwhite supremacistâ€ and â€œbigot.â€ But the network suspended her for suggestion a boycott of the Dallas Cowboys for cracking down on player protests. On the other hand, CNN fired host Reza Aslan for tweeting that Trump was a â€œpiece of s---â€ and â€œembarrassment to humankind.â€ CNN also fired pro-Trump contributor Jeffrey Lord for tweeting the Nazi salute â€œSieg Heil.â€ Sarah Sanders weighed in Wednesday, saying: â€œWhere was Bob Igerâ€˜s apology to the White House staff forÂ Jemele HillÂ calling the president and anyone associated with him a white supremacist? To Christians around the world forÂ Joy BeharÂ calling Christianity a mental illness? Where was the apology forÂ Kathy Griffin going on a profane rant against the president onÂ â€˜The Viewâ€™Â after a photo showed her holding President Trumpâ€™s decapitated head? And where was the apology from Bob Iger for ESPN hiringÂ Keith OlbermannÂ after his numerous expletive-laced tweets attacking the president as a Nazi and even expanding his role after that attack against the presidentâ€™s family?â€ Those are legitimate questions. In fairness, CNN dumped Griffin, and Olbermann, who made some extremely harsh anti-Trump videos for GQ, is being used by ESPN only on sports. But would the treatment have been different if the target wasnâ€™t Trump? The bottom line is that each media organization sets its own standards, depending on the gravity of the offense, the popularity of the performer and the personâ€™s past record. These problems were once far easier to sweep under the rug. But we all live in Twitterâ€™s world now, where one ill-chosen phrase can end a career and online mobs can form at a momentâ€™s notice. Roseanne Barr woke up Tuesday morning with the most popular show on television. But hours later she was unemployed because she touched the third rail of racism, and ABC executives concluded she had crossed a very bright line.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roseanne-blames-ambien-abc-herself-as-trump-also-hits-the-network,Media Buzz,Fox News,

But media watchers quickly pointed out his hypocrisy by pointing to Acosta's sitdown with singer John Legend's in 2015 to talk about the exact same subject. CNN star reporter Jim Acosta slammed Kim Kardashian Westâ€™s meeting with President Trump regarding prison reform on Wednesday as â€œnot normal,â€ but media watchers quickly pointed out his hypocrisy by pointing to Acosta&aposs sitdown with singerÂ John Legend&aposs in 2015 during President Obamaâ€™s administration to talk about the exact same subject. Kardashian, Kushner, and prison reform: What to know Kim Kardashian goes to the White House to discuss a topic that both she and top White House adviser Jared Kushner both champion: prison reform. A look at what you need to know about the bi-partisan issue. â€œShe shouldnâ€™t be here, talking about prison reform, itâ€™s very nice that she is here but thatâ€™s not a serious thing to have happened here at the White House,â€ Acosta  said on CNN Wednesday  in the middle of a rant about Trumpâ€™s tweet regarding Roseanne Barrâ€™s recent firing. Acosta took issue with Kardashian West and Trump reportedlyÂ discussingÂ prison reform and the possible pardon for a great-grandmother who is serving a drug-related life prison sentence. However, in 2015  Acosta sat down with Legend for a lengthy feature  on mass incarceration and the criminal justice system. When Legend declared that prison is not the solution to every problem, Acosta nodded approvingly before noting that prison reform is â€œpersonalâ€ for the musician. Legend and his celebrity wife, Chrissy Teigen, visited the White House several times during the Obama administration and once  hinted that they had sex  at an â€œObamaÂ thing.â€ Acosta never objected to any of Legendâ€™s meetings with Obama. CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding when Acosta changed his mind about celebrities discussing prison reform and visiting the White House. The double standard didnâ€™t go unnoticed. Mediaiteâ€™s Joseph Wulfsohn  penned a column headlined , â€œJim Acosta Trashes Kim Kardashianâ€™s Prison Reform Efforts As Not â€˜Seriousâ€™ After Taking John Legendâ€™s Seriously in 2015,â€ which examines the CNN starâ€™s abrupt change in attitude. â€œIf your argument is that Legend is some intellect singer-songwriter and Kardashian is some air-headed reality star, that misses the point. Look at what they have in common; theyâ€™re A-list celebrities with huge followings who have sincere passions that involve politics and in this case, both are using their celebrity status on prison reform,â€ Wulfsohn wrote. Wulfsohn gave Acosta the â€œbenefit of the doubtâ€ that sexism isnâ€™t a factor in the reporterâ€™s flip-flopped views on celebrities using their star power in an attempt to impact prison reform.  â€œPerhaps itâ€™s his disdain for Donald Trump, a president who he essentially admitted doesnâ€™t take seriously,â€ Wulfsohn added. Wulfsohn wasnâ€™t the only watchdog to notice Acostaâ€™s Hypocrisy. Fox News contributor Stephen Miller tweeted contradicting screen grabs of various tweets the CNN reporter has sent over the years, while countless others took to Twitter to mock Acosta.  AcostaÂ  recently bragged that he was kicked out  of the Oval Office by President Trump, saying he wears it â€œas a badge of honor,â€ while being glorified for serving as White House antagonist during an appearance on ABCâ€™s â€œJimmy Kimmel Live.â€ Earlier this year,Â  Trump kicked the CNN star out Â of the Oval Office after Acosta badgered the president with racially charged questions. Last month, Acosta was forced to do damage control after he was accused of taking personal shots at Trump supporters, saying â€œtheir elevator might not hit all floors.â€ He defended his comments, claiming that his words were â€œtwisted by some outlets.â€ Trump has famously dubbed CNN â€œfake newsâ€ and pointed directly at Acosta, calling him by the disparaging moniker in the past. Last December, Acosta was shut down by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders when he tried to hijack a press briefing and he has  also gotten into combative arguments Â with other members of the administration including former Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-star-jim-acosta-rips-kim-kardashians-prison-reform-meeting-with-trump-but-lauded-john-legends-activism-on-same-during-obama-years,Media,Fox News,
01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Scott Pruitt,EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt: Trump put America first when he withdrew from Paris Accord one year ago,"close Video Pruitt defends decision to withdraw from Paris climate deal Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency talks jobs, climate and President Trump's agenda on 'Fox News Sunday' One year ago, on June 1, 2017, President Trump boldly and courageously announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. This was a historic moment that upheld the presidentâ€™s campaign promise and demonstrated to the world that he puts the American people first. The presidentâ€™s decision, together with his decisive actions through regulatory reforms and tax relief, is unleashing the American economy. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 percent â€“ a low not seen since 2000. Since Election Day, the economy has added 3.3 million new jobs and wages are rising. The presidentâ€™s actions rejected the misguided narrative that we must choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. That is a false choice. And it is inconsistent with Americaâ€™s environmental track record. We can do both, and we have done both â€“ better than any other nation, in fact. The presidentâ€™s actions rejected the misguided narrative that we must choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy. That is a false choice. And it is inconsistent with Americaâ€™s environmental track record.  From 2000 to 2014, we reduced our carbon dioxide footprint by more than 7 percent. More recently, the Energy Information Administration projects that from 2010 to 2018 total U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are falling by nearly 7 percent. In contrast, global emissions are increasing by 10 percent. We have also made incredible strides improving air quality throughout the nation over the past several decades. Since 1970, total emissions of the six criteria air pollutants regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards established through the Clean Air Act have dropped 73 percent. These achievements are attributed largely to American innovation, such as highly effective pollution-control equipment, advanced production technologies, and increasingly efficient practices across all sectors of our economy. It is the genius of the free market, not burdensome government mandates, that has delivered this unrivaled accomplishment. The previous administration threatened to derail this progress through regulatory overreach. But President Trumpâ€™s actions ensure that we will continue to promote Americaâ€™s energy independence and economic growth, while also protecting the environment. Under the commitments made by the prior administration, the Paris Agreement was estimated to put at risk as many as 2.7 million American jobs by 2025, according to NERA Economic Consulting. At the same time, the Paris Agreement imposed no serious emissions reduction obligations on China or India for many years. On top of this, the Paris Agreement would also require the United States to contribute billions of American taxpayer dollars in the coming years, with no clear benefit to hardworking Americans. President Trump understood that this was a bad deal for the American people. The presidentâ€™s actions declared to the world that this administration will put the American people first. The days of Washington prioritizing the interests of other countries over the interests of the American people are over. Thanks to President Trumpâ€™s leadership, the Environmental Protection Agency has refocused on its core responsibilities of protecting human health and the environment. We are making tremendous progress on these fronts, including working cooperatively with states to improve air quality throughout the country, accelerating the cleanup of contaminated lands in the Superfund program, and incentivizing repairs to the nationâ€™s water infrastructure. Our booming economy and improved environment are a uniquely American success story that should be recognized, celebrated, and replicated around the world. We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship. President Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was one of the earliest indications of his commitment to put America first. From regulatory reforms to tax relief, the president continues to take decisive action on behalf of hardworking Americans.

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Fox News,Holder on a 2020 showdown with Trump: â€˜Two guys from Queens. That would be interestingâ€™,"close Video Is former AG Eric Holder planning a 2020 White House run? Former AG Eric Holder speaking at the 'Politics and Eggs' event at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, further fueling speculation he's planning a 2020 White House run; Peter Doocy reports. MANCHESTER, N.H. â€“  Eric Holderâ€™s visit Friday to the state that holds the first primary along the road to the White House sparked further speculation that the former attorney general is seriously mulling a Democratic presidential bid in 2020. In a speech and question-and-answer session at ""Politics and Eggs"" at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics â€“ a must-stop for potential presidential candidates â€“ Holder said only that a run is â€œsomething that Iâ€™m considering.â€ But he openly entertained what a matchup would look like between him and President Trump, both Queens natives. â€œTwo guys from Queens. That would be interesting. New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers,â€ Holder said with a smile. 
      Former Attorney General Eric Holder visited New Hampshire Friday and said that he would decide on a Democratic presidential run by early next year.
       (Fox News) â€œThe idea of a challenge, yeah that kind of appeals to me,â€ he offered. Holder repeated his often-used line that heâ€™ll decide on any Democratic presidential run by early next year. â€œI think the decision I make will be one that will be personal, whether or not I think I could contribute, whether I thought I could be a positive force. And I think it would really be something that I decide in a vacuum,â€ he said when asked by Fox News if a potential candidacy by former Vice President Joe Biden would weigh on his decision. But he wondered if his style would play on the campaign trail, adding, â€œIâ€™m a person whoâ€™s known as a guy who speaks his mind, and I wonder how that would resonate.â€ Holder, who ran the Justice Department from 2009 until 2015 under then-President Barack Obama, joked that â€œthere are some assumptions about why Iâ€™m here in New Hampshire.â€ Still, he maintained that the real reason he was in the state was in his capacity as chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee â€“ which aims to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering. Holder warned that â€œour democracy is under attack,â€ adding â€œweâ€™re up here to try to have an influence on state legislative races.â€ In a separate interview  on the eve of his New Hampshire visit, the nationâ€™s first black attorney general said he wouldnâ€™t label Trump a racist. But he added, â€œThe president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible. It is inconsistent with who we say we are as a people and it is not what we expect from somebody who is supposed to be the leader of the entire nation.â€ Video At the event in New Hampshire, Holder was asked to weigh in on the presidentâ€™s pardon this week of conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh Dâ€™Souza and Trumpâ€™s comment that he may commute the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. â€œIâ€™m a little concerned about whatâ€™s going on,â€ Holder said. â€œI think the president is trying to send a message to some people who might be involved in the Russia investigation.â€ Trump and his allies, though, stand by the latest pardons. The White House said D&aposSouza was ""a victim of selective prosecution for violations of campaign finance law."" John Dowd, former lead attorney for the president on the Russia probe, said, â€œI think the presidentâ€™s use of his pardon power to right the ship and correct eight years of despicable injustice is brilliant and just what our founding fathers had in mind to check rogue prosecutions and agents and rigged prosecutions."" During his speech, Holder focused on his redistricting mission. He urged that the process be taken â€œout of the hands of the politicians, because the reality that we have now is that politicians are picking their voters as opposed to citizens choosing who their representatives are going to be.â€ Following his ""Politics and Eggs"" appearance, Holder headlined a roundtable discussion on gerrymandering at the New Hampshire Democratic Partyâ€™s headquarters in Concord. Holder, who played basketball in high school and college, also weighed in on Game One of the NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers&apos JR Smith Thursday night made one of the costliest mistakes in pro-basketball history. â€œJR Smith, hang your head in shame,â€ he said. Later, Holder told reporters â€œif youâ€™re a pro, [you&aposre] supposed to remember what the score is.â€ â€œHeâ€™s a good player and we all make mistakes, but that was painful to watch,â€ Holder added.

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Kaitlyn Schallhorn,"Trump on North Korea, from 'Rocket Man' to 'fire and fury'","Throughout the first year of his presidency â€“ and even as he campaigned for the office â€“ President Trumpâ€™s rhetoric regarding North Korea has been harsh. He warned earlier this year that Americaâ€™s nuclear capabilities were â€œmuch bigger [and] more powerfulâ€ than that of the Asian nation. And at the end of 2017, Trump designated North Korea a state sponsor of terror again â€“ a classification that came with additional sanctions. On the heels of a planned, historic summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trumpâ€™s tone softened, saying â€œgreat progressâ€ has been made. But Trump ultimately cancelled that meeting, citing ""open hostility"" from North Korea. From agreeing to meet with Kim to dubbing him â€œLittle Rocket Man,â€ hereâ€™s a look at what Trump has said about North Korea and its leader over time. Back together again After  meeting with a North Korean official  in the White House for more than an hour, Trump announced the June summit with North Korea is back on. â€œWe&aposll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore,"" the president told reporters after the meeting. Let's call the whole thing off Trump  announced on May 24  that he has decided to pull out of the June summit with North Korea. ""We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant,"" Trump said in a letter to Kim. ""I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting."" ""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" Trump said. ""I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only that dialogue that matters. Some day, I look very much forward to meeting you,"" he added. ""In the meantime, I want to thank you for the release of the hostages who are now home with their families. That was a beautiful gesture and was very much appreciated."" Deal or no deal? After speaking with the South Korean president amid threats from the rogue regime to cancel talks,  Trump suggested  the historic summit between him and Kim might not happen after all. â€œIf it doesnâ€™t happen, maybe it will happen later. You never know about deals. Iâ€™ve made a lot of deals,â€ Trump said on May 22. â€œYou never really know. It may not work out for June 12.â€ Trump said he wants the Korean peninsula to be denuclearized in an â€œall in oneâ€ manner. â€œI can guarantee Kimâ€™s safety. He will be safe. He will be happy,â€ Trump said. â€œHis country will be rich.â€ Trump  also said  heâ€™s noticed a change in Kimâ€™s attitude recently. â€œI canâ€™t say that Iâ€™m happy about it,â€ he added. Save the date Trump officially announced that he would meet with Kim in Singapore on June 12. â€œWe will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!â€ Trump said in a tweet. The announcement came hours after Trump and the first lady  welcomed the three Americans  freed from detention in North Korea at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early on May 10. After Trump met with the three men, he publicly thanked Kim for releasing the prisoners. â€œWeâ€™re starting off on a new footing,â€ Trump said. â€˜Positive gesture of goodwillâ€™ In announcing that a date and place has been set for his much-anticipated meeting with Kim,  Trump also confirmed Â three American prisoners have been released. The three Americans â€“ Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song â€“ are returning to the U.S. with newly-confirmed Secretary of State  Mike Pompeo , Trump said in a tweet. The president confirmed the three men are also in â€œgood health.â€ WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN TRUMP, KIM JONG UN White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump â€œappreciates Kim Jong Unâ€™s action to release these American citizens, and views this as a positive gesture of goodwill.â€ Another American detainee, Otto Warmbier, died in June 2017 after he was released back to the U.S. with severe brain damage. â€˜Good relationship formedâ€™ Trump has confirmed thatÂ  CIA Director Mike Pompeo  â€“ his pick to lead the State Department â€“  secretly met with  Kim in April and a â€œgood relationship was formed.â€ He said the meeting â€œwent very smoothly.â€ The president also disclosed that the U.S. and North Korea have held direct talks at â€œextremely high levelsâ€ in preparation for the summit. Kim â€˜will do what is rightâ€™ AfterÂ  Kimâ€™s first reported visit to China , Trump said â€œthere is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity.â€ â€œFor years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility,â€ Trump said in a March tweet, adding that he is looking forward to his upcoming meeting with the North Korean leader. He also gave North Korea the benefit of the doubt earlier that month, saying  he believes the country will abide Â by its pledge to suspend missile tests. When Trump delivered a speech in Pennsylvania, the crowd booed the mention of Kim, but the president stopped them. â€œNo, it&aposs very positive ... no, after the meeting you may do that, but now we have to be very nice because let&aposs see what happens, let&aposs see what happens,â€ Trump said. Invitation accepted TrumpÂ  accepted an invitation Â fromÂ Kim to meet, the White House said. While a time and place has yet to be determined, the two leaders are expected to meet by June. The invitation to convene was extended by Kim. â€œKim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached,â€ Trump said on social media. â€œMeeting being planned!â€ â€œThe deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined,â€ he laterÂ said. â€˜Possible progressâ€™ As North Korea is reportedly willing to negotiate its nuclear weapons, Trump cautiously acknowledged â€œpossible progress.â€ â€œFor the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned,â€ Trump said on Twitter. â€œThe World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!â€ At a later White House news conference, Trump said he believed North Korea, which has a long history of deception and threats to target U.S. cities with nuclear missiles, is â€œsincere.â€ â€œWe have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,â€ Trump said. Of the possibility for peacefully resolving the nationsâ€™ deep differences, he said: â€œItâ€™d be a great thing for the world, would be great for North Korea, it would be a great thing for the peninsula.â€ â€œBut weâ€™ll see what happens,â€ Trump said. Spirit of the Olympics At the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Olympics, North Korea sent the U.S. a message through South Korea, saying it has â€œample intentionsâ€ of holding talks with America. During a meeting with the nationâ€™s governors at the White House in February, Trump said those talks will only occur â€œunder the right conditions.â€ The administrationâ€™s position has been that North Korea must get rid of its nuclear and missile programs first before any talks can take place. Relationship status: Itâ€™s complicated In an interview with theÂ  Wall Street Journal , Trump reportedly said he â€œprobablyâ€ has a â€œvery good relationshipâ€ with North Korea. Trump also suggested that he is open to diplomacy with the country heâ€™s spent years criticizing, the newspaper reported. â€œI have relationships with people. I think you people are surprised,â€ Trump said. The Wall Street Journal released theÂ  audio and transcript Â of the interview after Trump denied making the comments. 'Success for the world' Trump told South Korea that he would be open to talks with its northern neighbor â€œunder the right circumstances,â€ the White House said. Trump also took credit for the talks between North and South Korea ahead of next monthâ€™s Winter Olympics. At a January Cabinet meeting, Trump said it was his administrationâ€™s pressure on North Korea that caused the rogue nation to negotiate with the South. ""Without our attitude that would have never happened,"" Trump said of the inter-Korean dialogue. ""Who knows where it leads. Hopefully it will lead to success for the world â€” not just for our country but for the world, and we&aposll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens."" Whose button is bigger? After Kim warned Trump about North Koreaâ€™s nuclear capabilities, Trump hit back on social media, arguing that his â€œNuclear Buttonâ€ is â€œbigger [and] more powerful.â€ â€œNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the &aposNuclear Button is on his desk at all times,&aposâ€ the president tweeted. â€œWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!â€ Kim  previously warned  the U.S. â€œshould know that the button for nuclear war is on my table.â€ â€œThe entire area of the U.S. mainland is within our nuclear strike range,â€ he said. â€œThe United States can never start a war against me and our country.â€ Good news or bad news? Trump insinuated at the start of the new year that sanctions and additional â€œpressuresâ€ are having a â€œbig impact on North Korea.â€ â€œSoldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea,â€ Trump said. Kim â€œnow wants to talk to South Korea for the first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not â€“ we will see!â€ In his tweet, Trump was seemingly referring to the recent, dramatic escape of at least two North Korean soldiers across the heavily militarized border into the southern country He also alluded to Kimâ€™s recent comments indicating he would send a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be hosted in South Korea. Trump also took credit for the talks between North and South Korean leaders. â€œWith all of the failed â€˜expertsâ€™ weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasnâ€™t firm, strong and willing to commit our total â€˜mightâ€™ against the North,â€ Trump said in a Jan. 4 tweet. â€œFools, but talks are a good thing!â€ 'Sick puppy' While giving a speech on tax reform at a Missouri event in November, 2017, Trump digressed from the topic to call the North Korean leader a ""sick puppy."" His comments drew hoots from the crowd. State sponsor of terror Trump re-designated North Korea aÂ  state sponsor of terror Â on Nov. 20, 2017, citing its support of â€œinternational terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil.â€ During a Cabinet meeting, Trump announced the designation came along with new sanctions on the â€œmurderous regimeâ€ as part of the administrationâ€™s â€œmaximum pressure campaignâ€ in dealing with North Korea. He said these sanctions will be â€œthe highest level of sanctionsâ€ on the North. North Korea was on the list but was taken off by the Bush administration in 2008. Why can't we be friends? In aÂ  series of tweets while in Vietnam , Trump said he doesn&apost know why the North Korean dictator would ""insult"" him. â€œWhy would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me â€˜old,â€™ when I would NEVER call him â€˜short and fat?â€™â€Â  Trump said . â€œOh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!â€ The comment came afterÂ  Kim referred to Trump&aposs speech Â in South Korea as â€œreckless remarks by an old lunatic.â€ 'Donâ€™t try us' In Asia, Trump issued a stern warning to North Korea, saying it would be a â€œfatal miscalculationâ€ for the country to attack the U.S. or an ally. â€œThis is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past. Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,â€ Trump said during an address at South Koreaâ€™s National Assembly. North Korea â€œhas interpreted Americaâ€™s past restraint as weakness,â€ Trump said. 'Letâ€™s make a deal' While on his Asia trip, Trump implored North Korea to â€œcome to the tableâ€ for talks on its nuclear weapons program. Trumpâ€™s request for North Korea to â€œmake a dealâ€ was in stark contrast to his previous hardline rhetoric when it comes to the rogue nation. ""It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world,"" Trump said during a news conference alongside South Korean president Moon Jae-in in November 2017. Trump also said heâ€™s seen â€œa lot of progressâ€ in dealing with North Korea but still called the country a â€œworldwide threat.â€ In a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo the day before, Trump repeated his assertion that the â€œera of strategic patienceâ€ with North Korea was finished. â€œSome people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,â€ Trump said then. 'Rocket Man' is on a 'suicide mission' After dubbing him â€œRocket Manâ€ in a tweet, Trump eventually tried out the new nickname for KimÂ  during his inaugural address to the U.N. General Assembly . During his speech, Trump vowed to â€œtotally destroy North Koreaâ€ if the country so provokes him. He also said Kim was â€œon a suicide mission.â€ No more talking After North Korea said itÂ  successfully launched a missile Â over Japan, a U.S. ally, and into the Pacific Ocean, Trump initially had a subdued response. ""Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime&aposs isolation in the region and among all nations of the world,"" Trump said in a written statement after North Koreaâ€™s missile soared almost 1,700 miles into the Pacific Ocean, triggering alert warnings in northern Japan and shudders throughout Northeast Asia. ""All options are on the table."" The missile launch was said to be a â€œprecursorâ€ to North Koreaâ€™s containment of  the U.S. territory of Guam  by Kim, according to state-run media. But in a tweet, the president suggested the U.S. is finished â€œtalkingâ€ to North Korea. â€œThe U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer,â€Â  Trump tweeted . The U.S. is 'locked and loaded' TrumpÂ  took to social media Â in August 2017 to proclaim that the U.S. military is â€œlocked and loadedâ€ in case â€œNorth Korea act[s] unwisely.â€ 'Fire [and] fury' isn't 'tough enough' With the threat of nuclear violence growing, Trump warned North Korea on Aug. 8, 2017 that he would unleash â€œfire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.â€ But when tensions continued to rise and North Korea threatened to attack Guam, Trump said maybe that commentÂ  wasnâ€™t ""tough enough. "" ""Letâ€™s see what [Kim] does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before â€“ what will happen in North Korea,"" Trump said. Secretary of State Rex TillersonÂ  saidÂ Trump Â was ""sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un can understand, because he doesnâ€™t seem to understand diplomatic language."" Kim Jong Un is 'not getting away with it' Trump saidÂ Kim has â€œdisrespected our country greatly.â€ â€œHe has said things that are horrific. And with me, heâ€™s not getting away with it,â€ Trump said. â€œHe got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. Heâ€™s not getting away with it. Itâ€™s a whole new ball game.â€ 'Strategic patience â€¦ is over' After meeting with the South Korean president in Washington, D.C., in June 2017,Â  Trump said that Â the â€œera of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed.â€ â€œFrankly, that patience is over,â€ he said. As Trump made these comments, the U.S. was rocked with the death ofÂ  Otto Warmbier , the 22-year-old American college student who suffered extensive brain damage while being held captive in North Korea for more than a year. There are 'worse things' than assassinating Kim Jong Un

       (AP Photo/Korean Central News Agency) In anÂ  interview with CBS News Â during the presidential campaign, Trump said he could â€œget China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly.â€ When asked if he was talking about assassinating the North Korean dictator, Trump shrugged. â€œWell, you know, Iâ€™ve heard of worse things, frankly. I mean, this guyâ€™s a bad dude â€“ and donâ€™t underestimate him,â€ Trump said. â€œAny young guy that can take over from his father with all those generals and everybody else that probably wants the position, this is not somebody to be underestimated.â€ 'What the hell is wrong with speaking?' TrumpÂ  told supporters Â at a campaign rally in Atlanta that should Kim want to come to the U.S., he would be â€œaccept[ed].â€ â€œI wouldnâ€™t go there, that I can tell you. If he came here, Iâ€™d accept him, but I wouldnâ€™t give him a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people that rip us off when we give them these big state dinners,â€ Trump said in June 2016. â€œWhat the hell is wrong with speaking?â€ Trump said, referencing the criticism he received for being willing to talk with North Korea. â€œItâ€™s called opening a dialogue.â€ 'Maniac' During a GOP presidential debate in September 2015,Â  Trump railed Â on the â€œmaniacâ€ in North Korea while answering a question about Planned Parenthood and womenâ€™s health issues. â€œNobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there, and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea,â€ Trump said. â€œYou have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, â€˜Iâ€™m ready to use them,â€™ and we donâ€™t even mention it,â€ he continued. China needs to solve the problem Even before he was president, Trump urged China to step in and help alleviate problems with North Korea. â€œNorth Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders,â€Â  Trump tweeted Â in March 2013. In April 2013,Â  Trump continued Â that line of thinking, adding that â€œNorth Korea canâ€™t survive, or even eat, without the help of China.â€ He then accused China of â€œtauntingâ€ the U.S. As president, Trump has said he is â€œvery disappointedâ€ in actions China has taken regarding North Korea, particularly â€œallowing oil to go intoâ€ the nation. He also said a Chinese envoy to North Korea â€œhad no impactâ€ on Kim. Additionally, Trump has said heâ€™s spoken to Chinaâ€™s President Xi Jinping regarding the â€œprovocative actions of North Koreaâ€ as well as the planned meeting between Trump and Kim. â€œPresident Xi told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative,â€ Trump said in March 2018. â€œChina continues to be helpful!â€ 'Wack job' In April 2013,Â  Trump urged Â then-President Barack Obama to â€œbe very carefulâ€ with the â€œ28-year-old wack job in North Korea.â€ â€œAt some point we may have to get very tough,â€ he tweeted. 'Negotiate like crazy' Trump warned that the U.S. needed to â€œdo something to stopâ€ North Korea in 1999Â  during an interview with the late Tim Russert Â on â€œMeet the Press.â€ ""Do you want to do it in five years when they have warheads all over the place, every one of them pointing to New York City, to Washington and every one of us, is that when you want to do it, or do you want to do something now?â€ Trump said. â€œYou&aposd better do it now. And if they think you&aposre serious â€¦ they&aposll negotiate and it&aposll never come to that.â€ He said then that if he ever became president, the first step he would take would be to â€œnegotiate like crazyâ€ to make sure that the country would â€œget the best deal possible.â€ Trump also predicted then that in â€œthree or four years,â€ North Korea would have weapons aimed all over the world, including at the U.S. Fox News&apos Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-on-north-korea-from-rocket-man-to-fire-and-fury,North Korea,Fox News,
01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Marc Thiessen,Marc Thiessen: Democrats' dishonesty about MS-13 hands Trump a winning issue,"close Video President Trump slams 'MS-13 lover' Nancy Pelosi President Trump blasts the House minority leader as he fires up supporters at the Make America Great Again Rally in Nashville, Tennessee. How evil is MS-13? Last year, two gang members in Texas reportedly murdered a teenage girl as an offering to Satan. According to prosecutors, the gang leader (known as ""Diabolico"") told the young girl that ""the Beast"" wanted ""a soul"" before having his partner shoot her in the head and dump her body on a street corner.  As charges were read against the two, the Houston Chronicle reported, they ""laughed, smiled and waved for the media cameras."" MS-13 gang members, police have said, also stabbed a Maryland man more than 100 times before decapitating him and cutting out his heart ... lured a 34-year-old man to his already dug grave ... and stoned an 18-year-old boy to death and dumped his body under a bridge. MS-13 is a demonic death cult. And President Trump has Nancy Pelosi defending its members&apos humanity. When Trump declared at a White House roundtable ""You wouldn&apost believe how bad these people are. These aren&apost people. These are animals,"" he was clearly referring to MS-13. But the media and Democrats took the president&aposs quote out of context and declared that he had referred to all illegal immigrants as animals.  MS-13 is a demonic death cult. And President Trump has Nancy Pelosi defending its members' humanity. The Associated Press tweeted that ""Trump referred to those crossing US border illegally as &aposanimals.&apos"" The New York Times tweeted, ""Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting, calling those trying to breach the country&aposs borders &aposanimals.&apos"" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., declared, ""When all of our great-great-grandparents came to America they weren&apost &aposanimals,&apos and these people aren&apost either."" By the next morning, news organizations were walking back their stories. The Associated Press announced it had ""deleted a tweet from late Wednesday on Trump&aposs &aposanimals&apos comment about immigrants because it wasn&apost made clear that he was speaking after a comment about gang members."" But not Pelosi, the House minority leader. Even after it was clear that Trump was referring to gang members, the California Democrat still claimed the president had called ""undocumented immigrants"" animals, declaring at a news conference that his remarks were ""inhumane"" and that ""we&aposre all God&aposs children ... Does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?"" Of course, we are all created in the image and likeness of God. That is true of MS-13 members. It was also true of Usama bin Laden, Pol Pot and Adolf Hitler. But can you imagine Pelosi standing up in outrage to defend their humanity?  Referring to evil men as ""animals"" is a common colloquial expression. The Oxford Dictionary&aposs definition of the word ""animal"" includes ""a person without human attributes or civilizing influences, especially someone who is very cruel, violent, or repulsive."" It offers, as an example of its proper use: ""those men have to be animals -- what they did to that boy was savage."" Which is exactly how Trump used the word. To this day, Pelosi has neither retracted her remarks nor admitted she was wrong. So now Trump is giving as good as he got. ""I noticed recently where Democrats, Nancy Pelosi as an example, are trying to defend MS-13 gang members,"" Trump declared at a Long Island event last week. ""I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, &aposthey are people.&apos They are not people. These are animals.""  At a rally in Nashville this week, he announced to a cheering crowd that Pelosi ""loves MS-13,"" pointing out that ""I said they&aposre animals, and she said &aposhow dare you say that?&apos"" He then asked the crowd, ""What was the name?"" The crowd responded, ""animals!"" Expect to hear that refrain at many Trump rallies in the months ahead. Through their dishonesty, Democrats such as Pelosi have handed the president a winning issue. A Harvard/Harris poll finds that 56 percent of Americans agree with Trump that it is fair to call MS-13 ""animals"" (including 47 percent of Hispanics, and 41 percent of Democrats). Millions of Americans can&apost understand why Democrats seem more hostile toward Trump than a vicious gang that carries out savage killings. Is Trump wrong to say Pelosi ""loves MS-13""? Sure. But with her deceitful attack, she gave him the pretext to make that claim.  There is a lesson here for Democrats: Trump says enough outrageous things that Democrats shouldn&apost have to make them up. When the president has you defending the ""dignity and worth"" of MS-13 members, you&aposre doing something wrong.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marc-thiessen-democrats-dishonesty-about-ms-13-hands-trump-a-winning-issue,OPINION,Fox News,
01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Alex Pappas,Trump blasts cost of 'Russia Hoax' probe after $17M price tag revealed,"close Video Trump's legal team continue to consider Mueller interview The one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Mueller approaches and Trump's legal team tells Fox News it will be difficult to make a decision about a Mueller interview before that date. President Trump on Friday blasted the cost of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation, after a new filing revealed taxpayers have spent nearly $17 million on the Russia probe. â€œA.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!â€ Trump tweeted. The price tag was revealed in a  spending report Â released Thursday by the Justice Department. About $10 million was spent between October and March, the document states. That includes $4.5 million spent by Muellerâ€™s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigations. â€œThe department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,â€ the DOJ said in the report. â€œManagement takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.â€ Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Previously, the Justice Department said that during the May-September 2017 period, the investigation cost nearly $7 million â€“ bringing the grand total to date to $17 million. TRUMP COMPLAINS ABOUT COST OF RUSSIA PROBE That earlier sum included $3.2 million in direct Special Counsel expenses and $3.5 million for other DOJ expenses, covering costs like agents working on raids or interviews and other government contractors. The spending report said these expenses would â€œhave incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existenceâ€ of Muellerâ€™s probe. Mueller is investigating Russiaâ€™s attempted interference in the 2016 election, and whether there was any collusion with Trump campaign officials. The investigation has also ensnared other Trump officials, like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manfort, over other issues. Trump has repeatedly said there was â€œno collusion.â€ Fox Newsâ€™ Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-cost-of-russia-hoax-probe-after-17m-price-tag-revealed,Russia Investigation,Fox News,

President Trump said Friday that a high-stakes summit between him and Kim Jong Un is back on for June 12, following a lengthy meeting with a top North Korean official in the Oval Office. â€œWe&aposll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore,"" the president told reporters after the North Korean emissary left the White House. He called Friday&aposs meeting withÂ North Korea&aposs Kim Yong Chol a ""great start."" Trump confirmed that the visiting official gave him a personal letter from dictator Kim Jong Un, though he hadn&apost yet read it. ""We&aposre going to deal,"" Trump said. Trump spoke to reporters after an extraordinary scene played out on White House grounds, with Trump hosting the North Korean official for over an hour in the Oval Office -- the latest gesture in an effort by both sides to get talks back on track after North Korea&aposs belligerent rhetoric prompted Trump to nix the summit last week. Trump said the meeting was supposed to just be about ""the delivery of a letter"" but ended up being a lengthy conversation with the ""second most powerful man in North Korea."" â€œWe talked about a lot ofÂ things,"" Trump said. ""We really did.Â But the big deal will be on June 12.â€ After the meeting, Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo were seen taking photos with the visitors. Video Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton. He is North Korea&aposs former military intelligence chief and is one of the North Korean leader&aposs closest aides. Trump said they also discussed ending the Korean War between North and South Korea. â€œCan you believe that we&aposre talking about the ending of the Korean War?â€ Trump told reporters. â€œWe&aposre talking about 70 years.â€ TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT, FROM THE INVITATION TO THE CANCELLATION: A TIMELINE The official&aposs arrival in Washington came a day after Pompeo declared that he was confident negotiations with Pyongyang over holding a nuclear summit were ""moving in the right direction.""

""Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste,"" Pompeo said in New York after meeting with Kim. The two countries, eyeing the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. Kim Yong Chol left his hotel in New York City early Friday for the trip to Washington in a convoy of SUVs. Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country&aposs leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.""

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Kimberley A. Strassel,Kimberley Strassel: What really inspired the FBI to spring into action against Trump in 2016?,"close Video Strassel: Did FBI outright spy on the 2016 Trump campaign? On 'Hannity,' Kimberley Strassel expands on her Wall Street Journal piece that asks if the FBI placed a mole within Trump's 2016 campaign. To hear the Federal Bureau of Investigation tell it, its decision to launch a counterintelligence probe into a major-party presidential campaign comes down to a foreign tip about a 28-year-old fourth-tier Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos. The FBIâ€™s media scribes have dutifully reported the bare facts of that â€œintel.â€ We are told the infamous tip came from Alexander Downer, at the time the Australian ambassador to the U.K. Mr. Downer invited Mr. Papadopoulos for a drink in early May 2016, where the aide told the ambassador the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton. Word of this encounter at some point reached the FBI, inspiring it to launch its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign on July 31. For months weâ€™ve been told the FBI acted because it was alarmed that Mr. Papadopoulos knew about those hacked Democratic emails in May, before they became public in June. But according to the tipster himself, Mr. Papadopoulos said nothing about emails.  Notably (nay, suspiciously) absent or muddled are the details of how and when that information made its way to the FBI, and what exactly was transmitted. A December 2017 New York Times story vaguely explains that the Australians passed the info to â€œAmerican counterpartsâ€ about â€œtwo months later,â€ and that once it â€œreached the FBI,â€ the bureau acted. Even the Times admits itâ€™s â€œnot clearâ€ why it took the Aussies so long to flip such a supposedly smoking tip. The story meanwhile slyly leads readers to believe that Mr. Papadopoulos told Mr. Downer that Moscow had â€œthousands of emails,â€ but read it closely and the Times in fact never specifies what the Trump aide said, beyond â€œdirt.â€ When Mr. Downer ended his service in the U.K. this April, he sat for an interview with the Australian, a national newspaper, and â€œspoke for the first timeâ€ about the Papadopoulos event. Mr. Downer said he officially reported the Papadopoulos meeting back to Australia â€œthe following day or a day or two after,â€ as it â€œseemed quite interesting.â€ The story nonchalantly notes that â€œafter a period of time, Australiaâ€™s ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, passed the information on to Washington. â€ Keep reading Kimberley Strassel&aposs column in the Wall Street Journa l .",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kimberley-strassel-what-really-inspired-the-fbi-to-spring-into-action-against-trump-in-2016,OPINION,Fox News,
01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Stephen Sorace,Press barred from event where Samantha Bee apologizes for 'unfiltered' slam on Ivanka Trump while accepting 'social change' award,"close Video Samantha Bee goes after Ivanka Trump with vulgar slur Comedian is taking heat for her profane remarks about President Trump's daughter; reaction from 'The Five.' Newly notorious comedian Samantha Bee told a crowd in Los Angeles on Thursday that the media focus should shift from the â€œone bad wordâ€ she uttered to describe Ivanka Trump to the nation&aposs treatment of immigrant children and families, a report said. Press access was revoked hours before the Television Academy event, which honored Beeâ€™s show, ""Full Frontal,"" and six other programs as platforms for advancing social change, but  IndieWire  was able to report Beeâ€™s speech. â€œWe spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word, when we all should have spent the day incensed that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals,â€Â Bee said at NeueHouse Hollywood. â€œIf we are OK with that then really, who are we?â€ Bee, 48, a former member of comedian Jon Stewart&aposs ""Daily Show"" troupe on Comedy Central, was honored on the same day she apologized for calling Ivanka Trump a â€œfeckless c---â€ during the opening monologue of her Wednesday show,Â  Deadline Â reported. Ivanka Trump was criticized for a photo she shared, showing her hugging her son, amid reports that the Office of Refugee Resettlement had lost track of 1,500 immigrant children in the last three months of 2017. Bee admitted that while her show strives to view the world through an â€œunfilteredâ€ lens, there are times when she â€œshould probably have a filter.â€ â€œYou know, the thing is, our show is steeped in passion,â€ Bee told the audience. â€œEvery week I strive to show the world as I see it, unfiltered. Sometimes I should probably have a filter. I accept that. I take it seriously when I get it right and I do take responsibility when I get it wrong. Video â€œThere is power in saying what you feel without apology,â€ Bee said. â€œOK, and sometimes you also have to apologize.â€ The media was denied access to Thursday&aposs ceremony itself, but reporters and photographers had access to the red carpet preceding the event. Bee, however, was a no-show,Â  Entertainment Weekly Â reported. An apparently sudden increase in the number of press attending the event forced the Television Academy â€œto limit access to tonightâ€™s activitiesâ€ just hours before the red carpet. An academy rep told theÂ  Hollywood Reporter Â late Thursday afternoon that the press was no longer allowed into the reception â€œas a result of todayâ€™s events involving Samantha B.â€ TBS, the network that airs â€œFull Frontal,â€ also issued an apology after Beeâ€™s tweet: ""Samantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired.Â  It was our mistake too, and we regret it."" The segment has since been removed from the show&aposs YouTube page. At least  two advertisers so far have pulled sponsorship  from Beeâ€™s program. The other shows honored Thursday were â€œAndi Mack,â€ â€œDaughters of Destiny,â€ â€œForbidden: Undocumented & Queer in Rural America,â€ â€œLA 92,â€ â€œOne Day at a Timeâ€ and â€œ13 Reasons Why.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/press-barred-from-event-where-samantha-bee-apologizes-for-unfiltered-slam-on-ivanka-trump-while-accepting-social-change-award,Scandal,Fox News,"

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Howard Kurtz,"Trump's anti-media tweetstorm: Some hits, some misses, all red meat","close Video Kurtz: Trump melding Mueller and media attacks 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on President Trump's tweet-storm that ranged from criticizing the New York Times for incorrect rally information to calling out Disney president Bob Iger over the Roseanne firing. The president is mounting so many Twitter attacks against the press that itâ€™s a bit hard to keep up. Nevertheless, I shall endeavor to analyze them, knowing full well heâ€™ll have some new ones up before you read this. There has of late been a melding of two of his favorite targets, the Mueller investigation and the fourth estate, which Donald Trump apparently views as reinforcing each other. And besides, he doesnâ€™t need much of an excuse to whack the press (or engage in counterpunching, as he likes to view it). So hereâ€™s a snapshot, starting with the first of several Trump tweets from yesterday: â€œNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!â€ The context : The president was reacting to a  New York Times  story about a confidential memo by fired FBI deputy Andrew McCabe, saying Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein had told him that Trump asked him to mention Russia in his letter urging that Comey be canned. The scorecard : Russia was a factor, by the presidentâ€™s own account. Trump told NBCâ€™s Lester Holt soon after the firing that he was going to dump Comey â€œregardless of recommendationâ€ by Rosenstein. â€œAnd in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it&aposs an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.â€ The tweet : â€œThe corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?â€ The context : Thereâ€™s a semantic debate in the press over whether the FBIâ€™s informant in 2016, an American professor in London, was a spy infiltrating the Trump camp or just doing his job against possible Russian intelligence-gathering. The scorecard : The existence of the FBI informant who spoke to three Trump campaign advisers was revealed by the â€œfailing New York Times,â€ and sparked endless stories and segments. So itâ€™s not true that the media arenâ€™t mentioning itâ€”they just arenâ€™t doing it in the â€œSpygateâ€ terms that the president would prefer. The tweet : â€œIger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!â€ The context : This is a continuation of Trumpâ€™s criticism of Disney CEO Bob Iger after he personally apologized to Valerie Jarrett for the racist Roseanne tweet and canceled her hit sitcom. ABCâ€™s Brian Ross reported in December that Trump had told his adviser Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials during the campaign, which would have fueled the collusion argument (and the stock market did drop several hundred points). The truth was the Flynn had been asked to do this after the election, when such contacts would be routine for an incoming administration. The scorecard : This was a very bad mistake. But despite Trumpâ€™s assertion, ABC apologized for the story, issued a full retraction and suspended Brian Ross for a month without pay. Whatâ€™s more, Ross was transferred to a lower-profile job where he doesnâ€™t deal with White House politics. The tweet : â€œThe Failing and Corrupt  @nytimes  estimated the crowd last night at â€˜1000 people,â€™ when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockinâ€™. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who donâ€™t â€˜getâ€™ me, and never did!â€ The context : The Times did report from a Nashville rally this week that about a thousand folks had shown up. Trump often accuses the media of underestimating his crowd size, a dispute that famously dates back to Inauguration Day. The scorecard : The president is right on the facts, and the paper ran a correction. The author, Julie Hirschfeld Davis, tweeted: â€œPresident  @realDonaldTrump  is correct about his crowd last night. My estimate was way off, and we have corrected our story to reflect the fire marshalâ€™s estimate of 5,500 people. When we get it wrong, we say so.â€ So: Some hits, some overstatements, some misses, another day at the virtual office in the continuing warfare with the media.

Trump was foreshadowing a glowing unemployment report that showed the jobless rate dipped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. Although he and other key administration officials had been briefed a day earlier on the report, protocol calls for even the president to wait for the report&aposs official release from the Labor Department. Employers added 223,000 jobs, way up from the expected 188,000. Deep inside the report were other strong indicators that the nation&aposs economy is on the upswing.

           (AP) U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remained mute about her 2020 ambitions Thursday during a town hall meeting in her home state, but attacked the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policies as â€œimmoralâ€ and said she supports a ban on â€œweapons of war.â€ â€œThis administration, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, has put a target on Californiaâ€™s back and weâ€™re going to need to fight this,â€ Harris told a crowd of more than 1,000 people in the San Fernando Valley, many of whom were young students, the  Los Angeles Daily News  reported. â€œThis administration, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, has put a target on Californiaâ€™s back and weâ€™re going to need to fight this.â€ â€” U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She criticized the administration&aposs zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration, which has led to at least 1,300 children being separated from parents who attempted to cross the border illegally. Video â€œItâ€™s immoral,â€ she said. â€œAnd letâ€™s be clear, government should be in the business of keeping families together, not tearing them apart.â€ Harris received praise from progressives after her heated confrontation with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last month, in which she took the Trump administration official to task over the issue. But Nielsen denied the administration is intentionally splitting the families, explaining to Harris that parents who attempted to enter the country illegally may lose their children if they face charges or jail time, as according to the existing U.S. laws that precede the election of Trump. Video Harris, California&aposs junior U.S. senator, isnâ€™t facing re-election this year, but her town hall was held just days before Tuesdayâ€™s primary election in the state -- which Democrats hope will help solidify their domination in California and eventually flip seats in the U.S. Congress. But holding a town hall while not facing an election merely fueled speculation that Harris may run for president in 2020. Rather than dismiss the rumors about it, Harris told reporters that she had â€œno announcements to make.â€ Kamala Harris Hits White House as Less Illegal Immigrants Seek College Aid During the event, Harris outlined some of her policy wishes, including banning â€œweapons of warâ€ and introducing mandatory background checks. â€œItâ€™s a false choice to suggest you either support the Second Amendment or you want to take everyoneâ€™s guns away,â€ she told the audience. â€œThat is ridiculous.â€ â€œItâ€™s a false choice to suggest you either support the Second Amendment or you want to take everyoneâ€™s guns away. That is ridiculous.â€ â€” U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She also spoke about a bipartisan bill sheâ€™s working on with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would reform the courtâ€™s bail system. Harris wrapped up her appearance by saying that although Trump poses challenges to people, she doesnâ€™t believe the country is divided. â€œI reject that premise. I do not believe we are divided.

Four candidates are vying for the Republican nomination to take on Montana Sen. Jon Tester, an endangered incumbent Democrat, in the fall -- and President Trumpâ€™s effect on the Republican Party is showing among them. Combat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and state auditor Matt Rosendale have all thrown their hats into the ring for the Republican nomination for Senate. And although Tester, the incumbent, has already raised a lot of money for the election, whoever emerges from this group of men stands a good chance in the general election, Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor told Fox News. Fox Newsâ€™ considers the Montana Senate race to be one of eight toss ups in  the 2018 midterm elections . A look at the Republican candidates 
      From left, Russell Fagg, Troy Downing, Matt Rosendale and Al Olszewski are competing for the chance to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this fall.
       (AP Photo/Matt Volz) While there hasnâ€™t been much polling ahead of the June 5 primary election, Rosendale, 57, has emerged as a potential frontrunner, Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor, told Fox News. Rosendale has the endorsement of Republican Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. Like Paul, Rosendale bills himself as a libertarian-leaning candidate.  Rosendale, former majority leader in the state Senate, was elected as Montanaâ€™s state auditor in 2016. Fagg is a fourth-generation Montanan with some name recognition, as his father was involved with local politics as well, Parker said. Fagg is genteel and someone who would be difficult to attack during debates, Parker said, but he has â€œdemonstrated some aggressiveness in this primary.â€ But Fagg has a long judicial record, and opponents could point to a case to fit an argument that he isnâ€™t tough on crime. Olszewski is â€œsomebody who could be a very attractive candidate,â€ Parker said. An Air Force veteran and father to six, Olszewski was first elected to the state legislature in 2014 as a state representative. Now, heâ€™s a state senator. â€œHeâ€™s well-regarded among Republicans in the know and in the party, but heâ€™s had limited exposure to the electorate,â€ Parker said, noting that Olszewski hasnâ€™t run television or radio ads like his GOP opponents. A businessman, Downing founded a tech company that eventually merged with Yahoo. After 9/11, Downing joined the Air Force and served in Afghanistan. His work with veterans, too, has made him a potential dark horse candidate, Parker said. TRUMP CALLS ON TESTER TO RESIGN OVER RONNY JACKSON ALLEGATIONS But Downing isnâ€™t originally from Montana, Parker pointed out. And his home in Big Sky, Montana, where the private Yellowstone Club ski resort is, stands in stark contrast to the more rural Montanans. Downing  has the support of  former national security adviser Michael Flynn and  Trumpâ€™s children . Heâ€™s also â€œthe one who looks most Trumpianâ€ with his business credentials. â€œIf thereâ€™s a Trump guy, itâ€™s him,â€ Parker said of Downing. â€œItâ€™s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump,â€ Saldin said.Â â€œItâ€™s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana.â€ Even Fagg, who is considered a favorite among the more establishment Republicans in Montana, has tacked a little more in the direction of Trump, Saldin said, pointing to  ads  that have been deemed â€œaggressive."" Trump won Montana by about 56 percent in 2016. In comparison, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain took the state with about 50 percent. â€œItâ€™s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump,â€ Saldin said. â€œItâ€™s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana.â€ â€” Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor  Itâ€™s no secret that the four Republican candidates lack some of the perks that come with name recognition. In fact, the â€œbest two candidatesâ€ for beating Tester arenâ€™t even running in this election, several political scientists in the state have said. Ryan Zinke, a former U.S. congressman, joined  Trumpâ€™s Cabinet  when he was appointed secretary of the Interior Department last year. And the stateâ€™s attorney general, Tim Fox, decided to forgo the race, presumably to run for governor, Saldin said. But even without that star power, the four candidates still stand a chance because of something next to their name: Republican. â€œAnytime youâ€™re running as a Republican in Montana statewide, youâ€™ve got a shot,â€ Saldin said. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a foregone conclusion that Tester wins this.â€ A look at Tester 
      Sen. Jon Tester (right) leaves the Capitol following votes.
       (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Tester, 61, is a more conservative Democrat who has already emphasized his record of voting for more than a dozen bills signed into law by Trump in his  first television ad . In an age of increasingly polarizing politics, Testerâ€™s 30-second spot didnâ€™t critique the president. Whoever wins the Republican primary needs to tap into what made Trump so successful in rural areas during the 2016 election, such as appealing to voters who believe politicians arenâ€™t â€œspeaking to me,â€ Parker said. The Republican candidate can â€œembrace the idea of the perception of left behind rural voters and speak to that.â€ TESTER FEELING HEAT FROM TRUMP IN MONTANA SENATE RACE â€œFor Republicans to win the general, they need somebody who can kind of stem the flow of rural voters [siding with Democrats or not voting at all] and keep them in the Republicansâ€™ column,â€ Parker said. â€œCandidates need to be making inroads in suburban areas -- pick off suburban voters and be attractive to rural voters as well.â€ TrumpÂ  went after Tester  earlier this year during the kerfuffle over his pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department.  Adm. Ronny Jackson , who was the presidentâ€™s physician, withdrew his name from consideration for the Cabinet post followingÂ  allegations  about his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. Jackson was also accused of wrecking a government vehicle while intoxicated. â€œCandidates need to be making inroads in suburban areas -- pick off suburban voters and be attractive to rural voters as well.â€ â€” Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor The allegations were collected by Testerâ€™s office; he is the top Democrat on the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee. The White House disputed the accusations, and Trump called for Testerâ€™s resignation in April. â€œThe great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,â€ Trump said in a series of tweets. â€œAdmiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!â€ Trumpâ€™s attack on Tester could hurt his chances in the fall. â€œI think thatâ€™s the one thing thatâ€™s gone wrong for Tester,â€ Saldin said of Trumpâ€™s criticisms. â€œSo much has gone right for Tester. The thing with Jackson, it does threaten to hurt him, especially if Trump follows up and comes out here to campaign directly against him.â€ Saldin said the Tester campaign needed to â€œkeep Trump at armâ€™s length and just emphasis the areas in which Tester and Trump have been able to work together, especially on veteransâ€™ issues.â€ About 87,000 veterans live in Montana, according to  the U.S. Census Bureau . Along with Alaska and Maine,  Montana is considered  to have the most veterans per capita living in the state. On the other hand, Parker has argued Trumpâ€™s attacks might actually help Testerâ€™s campaign. Tester is considered a strong advocate for veterans in Montana, Parker  wrote for The Washington Post , and his fight with Trump over a beleaguered pick to lead the already embattled veteransâ€™ agency could further prove his dedication to those who served the country. â€œThe way Democrats win in Montana,â€ Parker said, is by having candidates who are â€œpersonable and well-liked and are pretty solid on things like guns and social issues. They peel off enough rural voters who like that person individually more than the Republican alternative.â€ Fox News&apos Joseph Weber contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-montana-senate-candidates-embody-trump-in-effort-to-take-on-tester,Midterm Elections,Fox News,

But in an interview on the eve of his trip to New Hampshire, Holder appeared to downplay the significance of his visit, saying, â€œAt this point, Iâ€™m just thinking about it.â€ Holder, who ran the Justice Department from 2009 until 2015 under President Barack Obama, is slated speak and take questions at â€œPolitics and Eggsâ€ at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. The speaking series is a must-stop for presidential candidates or potential White House contenders. â€œIâ€™ll try to decide early next year whether thereâ€™s another chapter in my public service career,â€ Holder shared. â€œAt this point, Iâ€™m really focused on the work of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and trying to deal with this whole question of partisan gerrymandering.â€ â€œAt this point, Iâ€™m really focused on the work of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and trying to deal with this whole question of partisan gerrymandering.â€ â€” Eric Holder, former U.S. attorney general Asked about the factors that will go into his decision on a presidential bid, Holder said, â€œCertainly chief among them is, can you win?

Holder 2020? Former AG floats potential White House run Dana Loesch sounds off on the former Obama administration official's latest interview. But the 67-year-old Holder argued the emphasis should be on experience and vision rather than age, saying, â€œI think that people need to be judged on the ideas that they have as opposed to the birthdate thatâ€™s on their birth certificate.â€ He added, â€œI think thereâ€™s something to be said about youth, but thereâ€™s something to be said also about having adequate amounts of experience. I think the ability to combine vision with experience, I think ultimately will produce the best candidate, whoever that is, for the party.â€ Turning to Donald Trump, the nationâ€™s first black attorney general said he wouldnâ€™t label the president a racist. But he added, â€œThe president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible. It is inconsistent with who we say we are as a people and it is not what we expect from somebody who is supposed to be the leader of the entire nation.â€ â€œThe president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible."" â€” Eric Holder, former U.S. attorney general Speaking two days after Roseanne Barrâ€™s racist tweet about former Obama White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett led to the cancellation of her hit ABC show â€œRoseanne,â€ Holder took aim at Trump. President Trump: Eric Holder protected Obama In wide-ranging interview with the New York Times, President Trump appears to take a swipe at Attorney General Jeff Sessions by praising Eric Holder's protection of former President Obama. â€œThis president has given license to people to say and do things that might not have occurred in the immediate past in our country. And, I think that we are going to be dealing with that long after the Trump presidency, trying to get a handle on those kinds of issues, the kind of things that Roseanne said,â€ Holder argued. After his â€œPolitics and Eggsâ€ appearance, Holder is expected to lead a roundtable discussion at the New Hampshire Democratic Partyâ€™s headquarters in Concord on gerrymandering. Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said the organization is â€œcommitted to having a far census in 2020 and fair redistricting in 2021.â€ Targeting the GOP, he added, â€œWithout some kind of independent or bipartisan process to create districts, Republicans have an ability to draw a map that favors their own candidates right down to the neighborhood level.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eric-holder-takes-aim-at-trump-in-nh-fueling-2020-speculation,POLITICS,Fox News,

The apology came a day after Bee used the slur on her TBS show, shocking viewers and critics alike. ""I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,"" Bee said in a statement. ""It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it."" TBS also issued an apology shortly after Bee&aposs tweet: ""Samantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired.Â  It was our mistake too, and we regret it."" Ivanka Trump was criticized by several celebrities this week for a snap she shared of her hugging her son amid reports the Office of Refugee Resettlement lost track of 1,500 immigrant children in the last three months of 2017. â€œIvanka Trump, who works at the White House, chose to post the second most oblivious tweet weâ€™ve seen this week,â€Â Bee said, citing Roseanne Barr&aposs racist tweet as the first.

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Associated Press,"The summit's back on: Trump, NKorea's Kim to meet after all","WASHINGTON â€“  After a week of hard-nosed negotiation, diplomatic gamesmanship and no shortage of theatrics, President Donald Trump announced Friday that the historic nuclear-weapons summit he had canceled with North Korea&aposs Kim Jong Un is back on. The June 12 meeting in Singapore, the first between heads of the technically still-warring nations, is meant to begin the process of ending North Korea&aposs nuclear program, and Trump said he believes Kim is committed to that goal. The announcement puts back on track a high-risk summit that could be a legacy-defining moment for the American leader, who has matched his unconventional deal-making style with the mercurial Kim government. Despite recently envisioning Nobel laurels, Trump worked on Friday to lower expectations for a quick breakthrough. ""We&aposre going to deal, and we&aposre going to really start a process,"" Trump said. He spoke from the South Lawn of the White House after seeing off a senior Kim deputy who spent more than an hour with him in the Oval Office. Much had been made of a letter his visitor was bringing from the North Korean leader, but Trump&aposs comments left it unclear when he had even managed to take a look at it. The president said it was likely that more than a single meeting would be necessary to bring about his goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. He said, ""I think you&aposre going to have a very positive result in the end, not from one meeting."" In the latest sign of hostility cooling down but hopes kept in check, Trump said he had unilaterally put a hold on hundreds of new sanctions against the North, without Kim&aposs government even asking. ""I&aposm not going to put them on until such time as the talks break down,"" he said. ""I don&apost even want to use the term &aposmaximum pressure&apos anymore,"" Trump added, referencing his preferred term for the punishing U.S. economic sanctions imposed on North Korea in response to its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. But he said he would not remove current sanctions until the North took steps to denuclearize. Trump warmly greeted Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party&aposs central committee, in the Oval Office, where a brief encounter meant for the hand delivery of a personal letter from Kim Jong Un became a longer discussion of areas of disagreement between the two countries. After the meeting, Trump posed for photos with Kim Yong Chol outside the Oval Office, and they talked amiably at Kim&aposs black SUV before he was driven away. Trump told reporters he hadn&apost yet read the letter from the North Korean leader and added with a smile, ""I may be in for a big surprise, folks."" But minutes earlier, he had described the note as ""a very interesting letter,"" and teased journalists about revealing its contents. Later Friday, deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that Trump had read the letter, but he did not reveal its contents. Plans for the meeting in Singapore had been cast into doubt after Trump suddenly announced his withdrawal last week, only to announce a day later that it could still get back on track. White House officials cast the roller-coaster public statements as reflective of efforts by each leader to test the resolve of the other. Trump cited increasingly bellicose statements from the North â€” and ignored messages about summit logistics â€” when he announced he was backing out of the summit in a strongly worded letter. He cited ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" by Pyongyang but also urged Kim Jong Un to call him. By the next day, he was signaling the event could be back on after a conciliatory response from North Korea. Within days, three teams of officials in the U.S., Singapore and the Korean demilitarized zone began meeting on preparations for the summit. Trump has declined to publicly acknowledge whether he&aposs spoken directly with Kim Jong Un ahead of the talks. Kim Yong Chol, whisked to the Oval Office by White House chief of staff John Kelly, is the most senior North Korean to visit in 18 years, a symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year. Questions remain about what a deal on the North&aposs nuclear weapons would look like. Trump said Friday he believed Kim Jong Un would agree to denuclearization, but the two countries have offered differing visions of what that entails. Despite Kim&aposs apparent eagerness for a summit with Trump, there are many doubts that he would fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his guarantee of survival. U.S. defense and intelligence officials have repeatedly assessed the North to be on the threshold the capability to strike anywhere in the continental U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile â€” a capacity that Trump and other U.S. officials have said they would not tolerate. Trump has promised that he will provide ""protections"" for Kim and his government in return for giving up the nuclear program. He also indicated that South Korea, China, and Japan would be prepared to invest in the North to boost its besieged economy. Kim Yong Chol left his hotel in New York City early Friday for the trip to Washington in a convoy of SUVs. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country&aposs leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before."" Kim Yong Chol was allowed into the United States despite being on a U.S. sanctions list, and granted special permission to travel outside the New York area to meet with the president. ___ Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Matthew Lee in New York contributed.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-summits-back-on-trump-nkoreas-kim-to-meet-after-all,MILITARY,Fox News,

          Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left and David Friedman, right, the new U.S. ambassador to Israel, attend a ceremony celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation and unification of Jerusalem, in front of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, May 21, 2017.
           (Associated Press) President Donald Trump is considering giving U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman more authority over the U.S. outpost that handles Palestinian affairs, five U.S. officials said, a shift that could further dampen Palestinian hopes for an independent state. Any move to downgrade the autonomy of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem â€” responsible for relations with the Palestinians â€” could have potent symbolic resonance, suggesting American recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem and the West Bank. As president, Trump has departed from traditional U.S. insistence on a ""two-state solution"" for the Mideast conflict by leaving open the possibility of just one state. As his administration prepares to unveil a long-awaited peace plan, the Palestinians have all but cut off contact, enraged by Trump&aposs decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The deliberations come as Friedman growing indignation in the U.S. over partisan comments and other actions in which he has publicly sided with Israel over its critics. For decades, the Jerusalem consulate has operated differently than almost every other consulate around the world. Rather than reporting to the U.S. Embassy in Israel, it has reported directly to the State Department in Washington, giving the Palestinians an unfiltered channel to engage with the U.S. government. Until Trump&aposs decision in December to move it from Tel Aviv, the United States did not recognize Jerusalem as Israel&aposs capital. The Jerusalem consulate provided services to Americans in Jerusalem and also served as the de facto U.S. embassy to the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem for the capital of a future independent state. But since Trump earlier this month moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the situation has become more complicated. Now the U.S. maintains an embassy in one part of the city and a separate consulate less than a mile away, potentially creating confusion about who has ultimate authority. No final decision has been made about what changes to make to the consulate&aposs chain of command, a decision complicated by the consulate&aposs unique circumstances. But the embassy, run by Friedman, is expected to end up with ultimate authority over the consulate, officials said. They weren&apost authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/after-us-embassy-move-trump-weighs-jerusalem-consulate-changes,World,Fox News,

01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Peggy Grande,"On North Korea, Trump is wisely following Reagan's example","close Video Trump announces June 12 summit with Kim Jong Un is back on President Trump remarks following completion of Oval Office meeting with North Korean official Kim Yong Chol. Now that his summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is back on for June 12 in Singapore, President Trump will benefit from some important lessons he appears to have learned by studying the success of President Reagan in dealing with the Soviet Unionâ€™s final leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. This should give all Americans comfort. Few predicted Ronald Reagan would win the Cold War without firing a shot. In the same way, few imagined that Donald Trump â€“ who, like Reagan, entered the White House with little foreign affairs experience â€“ would bring North Korea to the negotiating table to discuss the elimination of its nuclear arsenal and future nuclear capabilities. We know President Reagan succeeded. We hope President Trump will as well. As he prepares for his summit with Kim Jong Un, President Trump should heed the Russian proverb that President Reagan embraced in his nuclear disarmament negotiations with Gorbachev: â€œ Doveryai, no proveryai,â€  which means â€œtrust, but verify.â€ Just as promises made by the Soviet leader were meaningless without verification, the same is true with North Korea. Kim Jong Un, along with his father and grandfather who ruled North Korea before him, has a long record of broken promises. President Trump knows from his extensive career in business that without binding agreements, clear penalties for violations and established methods for verification, the words of the North Korean leader are worthless. President Trump receives personal letter from Kim Jong Un Historian and author Evan Thomas joins 'Your World' with insight on the significance of letter-writing in politics, building strong relationships among leaders. President Trump is also wisely continuing President Reaganâ€™s belief in â€œpeace through strengthâ€ â€“ both in military capability and in economic capacity. President Trump knows the sanctions have been working to apply pressure to a fragile and failing North Korean economy, which puts him in a position of strength at the negotiating table. In fact, the seal of the president of the United States has an eagle in the center clutching the olive branch of peace in one talon â€“ and the arrows of war in the other. President Reagan in the 1980s and President Trump now extends an olive branch of peace first, with the hope that the arrows of war will not be needed. Yet both presidents have been unafraid to make their counterparts aware that America has the capacity, and the will, to defend itself if provoked. At the Reykjavick, Iceland summit on nuclear disarmament, President Reagan eventually walked away from the negotiating table because Gorbachev wanted America to put an end to its Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) â€“ the missile defense program some dubbed as â€œStar Wars.â€ Stating that SDI was non-negotiable for the U.S., President Reagan refused further discussion and got up and walked out. While the summit was deemed a failure by many in the media because no agreement was reached on that day, President Reaganâ€™s strong stance moved talks forward to a point where they could be resumed a short time later. The groundwork was laid at the summit for much of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in 1987 by Reagan and Gorbachev, eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons. President Reagan was committed to putting America&aposs interests first and would rather have no deal than a bad deal that weakened the United States. With his America First foreign policy, President Trump clearly is taking a similar position. President Reagan knew the importance and effectiveness of face-to-face diplomacy and believed there was nothing that couldn&apost be resolved if two leaders sat down across the table from each other to discuss their differences, as well as their shared goals. President Trump is committed to having a face-to-face conversation with Kim Jong Un, which will be a diplomatic milestone with global importance. History is judging Ronald Reagan as one of our greatest presidents, while Donald Trump is still writing the record of his presidency by which history will ultimately judge him. But by looking to the diplomatic and negotiating success of President Reagan and following in his footsteps, President Trump has wisely chosen an outstanding leader to emulate.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/on-north-korea-trump-is-wisely-following-reagans-example,OPINION,Fox News,
01/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,1,Stephen L. Miller,"President Trump, cut the celebrity shenanigans and commute the sentences that actually matter","close Video Trump considering pardon for Martha Stewart President Trump says he is considering commuting sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. One of the absolute powers that rests with the presidency is pardon power. The power to pardon anyone for anything anytime. Presidents using their pardon power for political or ideological purposes is nothing new. President Clintonâ€™s pardon of the late billionaire financier Marc Rich (whose ex-wife was a major Democratic Party donor) is a prime example. President Obamaâ€™s election-timed pardon of Chelsea Manning (convicted of violating the Espionage Act for leaking classified government documents to WikiLeaks) is another example. And who can forget President Fordâ€™s pardon of President Nixon, who resigned in disgrace as a result of the Watergate scandal? President Trump is no different. He announced Thursday via his Twitter account that he is pardoning conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh Dâ€™Souza for a felony violation of federal campaign finance law â€“ a charge Dâ€™Souza pleaded guilty to. President Trump earlier made waves by pardoning former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of criminal contempt of court for violating a federal judgeâ€™s order dealing with the detention of illegal immigrants. Both Arpaio and Dâ€™Souza are staunch allies of the president, as well as celebrity figures on the right. That doesnâ€™t change the fact that the president has the power granted to him to pardon whomever he wants. Shortly after President Trump discussed the Dâ€™Souza pardon Thursday, while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the president said he is considering clemency for both TV personality Martha Stewart and former Illinois Democratic Gov. Illinois Rod Blagojevich. This all came the day after President Trump huddled with mega-star Kim Kardashian West at the White House to discuss prison reform. These are all high profile pardons certain to generate headlines for President Trump. Stewart came away from her short prison stint still an incredibly wealthy woman. Dâ€™Souza is still making money from conservative speaking tours. But there are other cases, involving other individuals worthy of the presidentâ€™s attention and his pardon pen, who donâ€™t have the media or money-making advantages of Stewart or Dâ€™Souza. Most recently, the case of Matthew Charles  has made national headlines , uniting both right and left media and recently also came to the attention of Kardashian West herself. Fox News reported: â€œCharles was released from prison early in 2016 but is scheduled to go back to jail after a federal court said his reduced sentence was an error, Nashville Public Radio reported. Charles, who is in his 50s, already served 21 years for selling crack to an informant, but he was sentenced to 35 years, according to Nashville Public Radio. While in prison, Charles took college classes and became a law clerk. He even taught a GED program. He&aposs had a job since he&aposs been released.â€ As originally reported by Julieta Martinelli  for Nashville Public Radio, Charles had also spent his free time volunteering at a food pantry in Nashville that serves many at-risk young men also attempting to turn their lives around. Matthew Charles is the textbook case Americans hope for as they point to the increasingly flawed rehabilitation prison system. He has done everything one can do to turn his life around and contribute to his community. His return to prison is a grave injustice that President Trump can and should correct, immediately. Charlesâ€™ case is not as glamorous as Martha Stewart and wonâ€™t fire up the base as much as Dâ€™Souza, but it will have a far greater impact on the American community than either of those commutations. There is no easier way to unite a country than to use the power granted to the presidency on a case the country is already united on. Along with Charles is the case of Alice Marie Johnson, whom Kardashian West has devoted much of her celebrity platform to working to help. As  Fox News reported :Â  â€œAlice Marie Johnson was arrested in 1993 and convicted of drug conspiracy and money laundering in 1997, Mic previously reported. She became involved with cocaine dealers after she lost her job, her son was killed, she got divorced and her home was foreclosed on, according to Mic. â€œJohnson reportedly did not sell drugs or participate in drug deals, but she did admit to acting as an intermediary for those involved, passing along messages. She was sentenced to life in prison â€“ without parole. Kardashian West has already talked about a potential pardon for the great-grandmother with Jared Kushner, the presidentâ€™s son-in-law who has an interest in prison reform.â€ The message here should be simple: Cut the celebrity shenanigans Mr. President, and commute these sentences that actually matter. The danger we have always faced as a country with putting celebrities at the forefront of policy â€“ as President Obama was more than fond of doing, whether it be Hollywood activists or presidents â€“ is that the concerns of the average American, the forgotten man or woman, become ignored in the bright media spotlight as entertainment and politics increasingly collide in a social media driven atmosphere. Is this not your entire platform, Mr. President?Â Matthew Charles is the forgotten man. Commuting the sentences of Arapio, Blagojevich, Stewart and Dâ€™Souza makes for a great season of White House Celebrity Apprentice. Commuting the sentences of Matthew Charles and Alice Johnson is what makes a country great. Donâ€™t forget them, Mr. President.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/president-trump-cut-the-celebrity-shenanigans-and-commute-the-sentences-that-actually-matter,OPINION,Fox News,

The two leaders have gone back-and-forth on whether they will hold a historic summit this summer as a push for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula continues. After initially accepting Kimâ€™s invitation, Trump announced he was pulling out of the summit in a letter to the North Korean leader in May. But since then, as talks between officials have continued, TrumpÂ said the meeting is back on, according to plan. Read on for a look at how the meeting came about, fell apart and came back together. Trump accepts invitation Trump  accepted Kimâ€™s invitation  to meet in early March, the White House said. â€œPresident Trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would eventually meet with Kim when conditions were right,â€ then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. â€œAnd I think in the presidentâ€™s judgement that time has arrived now.â€ Date, time and place is set It wasnâ€™t until May when the date for the summit was publicly set: June 12. Trump said in a tweet that he and Kim would â€œboth try to make it a very special moment for World Peace.â€ The meeting was scheduled to take place in Singapore. Leaders waffle on meeting Later in May, Trump began to suggest a reverse in courseÂ on whether the meeting would take place as North Korean officials threatened to cancel talks. â€œIf it doesnâ€™t happen, maybe it will happen later. You never know about deals. Iâ€™ve made a lot of deals,â€  Trump said  on May 22. â€œYou never really know. It may not work out for June 12.â€ The comments came after a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House. Later, after Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News Kim had â€œaskedâ€ for the meeting, North Koreaâ€™s vice foreign minister  accused the U.S.  of â€œmisleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us.â€ â€œWe will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us,â€ Choe Sun Hui reportedly said. Trump backs out Trump  announced on May 24  that he decided to pull out of the summit in an open letter to Kim. â€œI was very much looking forward to being there with you,â€ Trump wrote. â€œSadly ... I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.â€ â€œI felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only dialogue that matters,â€ Trump continued. â€œSome day, I look very much forward to meeting you.â€ The White House  also revealed  that North Korean officials had stopped coming to recent meetings regarding the summit. North Korea reverses course After Trump pulled out of the summit, North Korea said it was  still willing  to come to the table. â€œWe express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,â€ North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said on May 25, according to Korean Central News Agency. Trump offers hope for the meeting Trump suggested a summit could still take place in June in a May 25 tweet. â€œWe are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit, which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th, and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date,â€ Trump said. South and North Korea meet again Kim and Moon  held a surprise meeting  on May 26 on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone reportedly to discuss a path forward for the summit with Trump.

It will happen!â€ U.S. officials also  reportedly met with  Kim Chang Son, the North Korean leaderâ€™s chief of staff, in Singapore on May 28. â€œWe have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea,â€ Trump said in a tweet the following day. â€œMeetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more.â€ New York City meetingsÂ  Kim Yong Chol, one of Kimâ€™s closest aides and North Koreaâ€™s former military intelligence chief, met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  in New York City  on May 30.

          A meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly in the works.
           (AP) A summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is in the works, Fox News has learned. Trying to organize the meeting between the two world leaders â€œhas been an ongoing projectâ€ for Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, sources told Fox News on Friday. The ambassador has reportedly been in Washington working on the plans. TRUMP SAYS SINGAPORE SUMMIT WITH KIM IS BACK ON AFTER MEETING NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL â€œThis has been an ongoing project of Ambassador Huntsman, stretching back months, of getting a formal meeting between Putin and Trump,â€ a source  told the Wall Street Journal .

 Talks  continued Thursday  between North Korean and U.S. officials to revive a summit between President Trump and dictator Kim Jong Un, as the president announced he would meet with a North Korean delegation Friday to receive a letter from Kim.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  said a summit is now â€œexpected.â€ One thing is clear: Presidentâ€™s Trumpâ€™s decision last week to cancel the summit, which had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, played a crucial role in getting the North to scramble and change its behavior to try to get the summit back on track for the original date or later. The presidentâ€™s decisive action calling off the summit was a skillful exercise in diplomacy. The cancellation showed the North that President Trump would not beg Kim â€“ the leader of a small and impoverished communist state â€“ to meet. Kim appears to realize now that he is dealing with a different kind of opponent. President Trump wants North Korea denuclearized on American terms, verifiably and irreversibly. Whether this is possible remains to be seen, but the president knows how to play the diplomatic game. The presidentâ€™s decisive action calling off the summit was a skillful exercise in diplomacy. The cancellation showed the North that President Trump would not beg Kim â€“ the leader of a small and impoverished communist state â€“ to meet. President Trump is projecting strength and because of that heâ€™s giving the U.S., our allies, and indeed the whole world a real chance to stop North Korea from becoming a greater international nuclear threat. Itâ€™s been apparent for some time that President Trump has two objectives. His ultimate goal is to remove North Koreaâ€™s nuclear threat. His interim goal is to force North Korea into negotiations over denuclearization. To achieve the interim goal, President Trump substantially increased the downsides of Kimâ€™s nuclear provocations â€“ to both North Korea and its patron China. That was the point of the presidentâ€™s â€œmaximum pressureâ€ policy against the North. President Trumpâ€™s tough-talking personal exchanges with Kim before the summit was first announced showed that he is prepared to risk destabilizing the Korean Peninsula rather than cave in to whatever the North Koreans demand. At the same time, the president toughened sanctions against North Korea, surged aircraft carriers to the Western Pacific, forged an even closer relationship with Japan, raised the visibility of military exercises with South Korea, and strengthened his personal interactions with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. President Trump calculated that these moves would force China and the North Koreans away from a policy of provocation. For all Kimâ€™s bluster, he doesnâ€™t want conflict on the peninsula. Neither do the Chinese. Sanctions are a real threat to Kimâ€™s regime, and a stronger American and allied presence in the region runs directly counter to the interests of both China and North Korea. The world was shocked in March when Kim offered â€“ and President Trump accepted â€“ an invitation to meet to negotiate denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This showed that the maximum pressure policy was working. Some experts wanted the president to refuse the invitation, conveyed by South Korea, to meet with Kim. But President Trump couldnâ€™t do that â€“ it would have embarrassed our South Korean ally. Besides, the president wanted the negotiations. So he accepted the invitation, while insisting that the talks would go nowhere unless the North Koreans agreed to denuclearization. The first step in negotiation is always getting the other side to the table. But thatâ€™s hardly the end of the story, particularly when your opponent is practiced at taking advantage of his opposition. In this respect, it was certainly foreseeable that Kim would test President Trumpâ€™s mettle. North Korea first attempted to posture itself as a cooperating negotiation partner, meeting with then-CIA chief Mike Pompeo, suspending nuclear and long-range missile tests, and releasing three Americans unjustly imprisoned. President Trump countered by holding out the prospect of easing economic sanctions, softening our military pressure, and saying he would protect the North Korean dictator from being ousted and assassinated. All of this was intended to signal good faith without making any real concessions. Not surprisingly, as the date for the summit drew closer, the North quickly switched negotiating postures. North Korean officials snubbed a White House advance team in Singapore, labeled Vice President Mike Pence (notably, not President Trump) a â€œpolitical dummyâ€ and boasted of a â€œnuclear-to-nuclear showdownâ€ between the two nations. All these insults, boasts and threats by the North were a test. The North Koreans were gambling that President Trump had overinvested in the idea of negotiations and would do whatever needed to preserve the June 12 summit in Singapore. Just as President Trumpâ€™s book â€œThe Art of the Dealâ€ says, the No. 1 rule of negotiation is that you have to be able to walk away from the table. If you canâ€™t â€“ if you show that you want an agreement more than the other side wants it â€“ youâ€™re doomed to a bad deal. So last week, President Trump walked away. He cancelled the scheduled summit, turning the tables on the North Koreans and tested them to see how badlyÂ  theyÂ  wanted to get to the table. President Trump was not the first president to walk away from a high-risk negotiation. President Reagan did it during negotiations on nuclear disarmament with the Soviet Union at the 1986 Reykjavik summit in Iceland, when the Soviets dug in their heels on the issue of missile defense. It was a courageous move by President Reagan, who was more concerned with long-term results than immediate political benefits. The Soviets came back to the table and Reagan got what he wanted. Conversely, when negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programs, the Obama administration was unwilling to walk away. It repeatedly set forth non-negotiable positions that it then proceeded to negotiate away. The result was a bad agreement. President Trump had to drive home the message to the North Koreans that President Obama is not his role model. He had to make the point that under his leadership, the United States would not move from its most important demands. That clarity was necessary to set the right negotiating framework for the longer term. While the political left was busy ridiculing President Trumpâ€™s decision to cancel the summit, North Korea immediately backtracked â€“ like a bully who retreats when his target stands up to him. Last Friday,Â  Kim announced Â that he was still willing to meet with President Trump â€œat any time.â€Â North Korean foreign ministry official Kim Kye Gwan expressed North Koreaâ€™s appreciation for President Trump â€œhaving made the bold decision, which any other U.S. presidents dared not, and made efforts for such a crucial event as the summit."" Later that day, South Korean President Moon had a surprise meeting with Kim Jong Un in the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas, and on Sunday officials from North Korea and the United States began meetings to discuss the summit. This dance will continue. We can expect further attempts to get the United States to reduce its pressure without receiving any real concession in return. That strategy has worked for North Korea in the past. Itâ€™s not likely to work with the leader America now has in the Oval Office.

This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" June 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We&aposll be meeting on June 12th in Singapore. It went very well. I think it&aposs a getting to know you meeting plus.  I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it is going to be a process. But the relationships are building and that is very positive. They want to develop as a country. That&aposs going to happen.  I told them today, take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly.  We have very significant sanctions on the, but we have hundreds that are ready to go. But why I do that when we are talking so nicely?  (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It&aposs on again. June 12th, Singapore, the summit, and today a top North Korean official delivering a letter that was eventually read, we&aposre told, by President Trump, as he headed out to Camp David. But the summit is back on, and where do we go from here? Let&aposs bring in our panel: Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president; Leslie Marshall, syndicated talk radio host, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist. Tom, significant? We&aposve talked about how the terminology is kind of changed and how the president is saying it might be one, it might be two, it might be a number of summits.  TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Walking back expectations a little bit. But it seems that the president still believes that denuclearization is on the table. Not sure that is where the North Koreans are. But yes, look, the summit is back on track and by all accounts is going to happen in less than two weeks. And we were told by everybody and not too long ago that it would be impossible for this to happen, and yet here we are.  BAIER: Leslie? LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I was wrong. Do you remember last time I was on your show?  BAIER: Can we tape that? MARSHALL: We were in Los Angeles. I said it would be on, I was correct there, but I said it wouldn&apost happen on the 12th. Then again it still may not. I think that Kim Jong-un and the president, North Korea and the United States have very different ideas of what denuclearization mean, and I don&apost think Kim Jong-un is going to budge with regarding to the troops being on the peninsula in South Korea. I don&apost think there will be any kind of a deal unless all troops are gone.  We&aposre not going to remove all the troops so I don&apost think we&aposre going to be able to get the kind of deal we want, and I think that&aposs why we are hearing the posturing that we&aposre hearing right now from both the president and Pompeo with regard to, it&aposs going to take a little time, we&aposre going to have more than one meaning. And I think that&aposs why, because I think there are two different definitions here and ideas of what they hope to achieve.  BAIER: I know a little bit about summits, wrote a little book about Reagan and Gorbachev. And sometimes it&aposs an evolution. Sometimes it does take more than one. They took Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: In this case if you just think back to when the Trump administration started, there were no lines of communication open, even there were no backchannel lines of communication open. And here you have visiting the White House today a top North Korean official, really actually a pretty bad guy who was visiting the White House.  BAIER: Spy chief.  HEMINGWAY: It&aposs really interesting just how far things have gotten. I think it is good that people are resetting expectations about what can be accomplished at this first summit, but just the fact that people are meeting is really significant. It&aposs also worth remembering that when Barack Obama said that he would be willing to sit down with bad guys, a lot of people on the right thought that was a really bad idea when he said I am willing to sit down with people without agreements beforehand. And I think this shows that sometimes that is a good idea. Sometimes you do have to work with people who might be pretty evil people but just to get things going and that there might be something good about that.  BAIER: It&aposs not really known or talked about much, but President Bill Clinton considered going to sit down with Kim Jong-un and instead sent Madeleine Albright -- Kim Jong-il, I should say, the father, had that meeting. And that&aposs the picture you have of Madeleine Albright toasting champagne with him. There was another meeting that concerned the president today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I didn&apost like the Russian meeting yesterday. I said, what is the purpose of that? But it could be a positive meeting. If it is a positive meeting I love it. If it&aposs a negative meeting I am not happy. And it could very well be a positive meeting. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You just hear what&aposs on his mind. You can&apost say he&aposs not transparent. He didn&apost like the Russian meeting, but he doesn&apost know what the meeting was about.  BEVAN: That&aposs what&aposs fascinating to me about this is Trump is very transparent and honest which typically diplomatic speak is much more cagey and sophisticated than that. And he&aposs willing to say, hey, we might get something done, we might not. We&aposll wait and see. It really does have the appearance of a guy who is on a high wire without a net, which is a spectacle to watch but also a little bit frightening, we&aposll see.  BAIER: But the Russian thing did upset some in the foreign policy realm in that Russia going to meet Kim Jong-un, Leslie, saying essentially remember us, and what are you doing, and maybe sticking their nose in it.  MARSHALL: Not only that. I think Russia is sticking their nose in almost everything we do, especially our elections. Maybe there were helping with that letter the president read or didn&apost read. But with regard to Kim Jong-un, maybe Kim Jong-un and the North Koreans don&apost have the -- maybe we don&apost have the upper hand with them or as much as an upper hand with them as we think, and I think that with that meeting, the president has to remain on his toes even more so.  BAIER: Let me play this one last sound bite and that is about the tariffs and the implication of that from the president&aposs point of view.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: All of these countries including the European Union, they charge five times the tariff. We don&apost charge tariffs, essentially. They charge five times what we charge for tariffs. And I believe in the word reciprocal. If you&aposre going to charge five time, we&aposre going to charge five times. I like free trade, but I want fair trade. At a minimum I want fair trade.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: There&aposs all this pushback, Republicans, Democrats saying what are we doing with allies? You know what, Larry Kudlow said this is a family squabble and we&aposre going to keep the lines of communication open and we&aposre going to see where this goes.  HEMINGWAY: And free trade is it preferable. It&aposs also true that our allies have had really good trade arrangements for us for a very long time, and there were good foreign policy reasons for that as we were trying to help strengthen these countries during a long cold war. But the point remains that they charge much higher tariffs than we do. That&aposs not necessarily a great idea. It&aposs not necessarily in our best interests. And it&aposs not like we are breaking up a perfectly free trade environment here. We are talking about renegotiating some arrangements.  BAIER: I mentioned the politics of this, Tom, and as you look at different places that could be affected, it doesn&apost line up to help Republicans and president&aposs party in the midterms on this particular issue. More Democrats like Sherrod Brown and Heidi Heitkamp and others whom maybe benefit from this?  BEVAN: I think it remains to be seen. Again, this is going to be an election that is a base. It is all about turning out votes. And so this is something that Trump&aposs voters have, this is one of his campaign promises. This is one of the things that animated the base to turn out for him in 2016.  BAIER: Even if it knocks down the GPD by a percentage, by one point? You have a great jobs number today. And if it takes its down one percent, as Wilbur Ross says it might, and he says that&aposs not a big deal in the big picture when you have tax cuts that you are supposedly paying for by increasing growth, does that affect people and how they look at this?  BEVAN: It will if it affects their pocketbooks. If they are paying more for goods and services that they would not have otherwise paid in October, a few weeks before the election, it will have a material impact. If the economy keeps humming along and things are fine, it won&apost affect them. So we&aposll have to wait and see. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

A draft report by the Senateâ€™s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that, in early 2016, the Obama Treasury Department issued a license to Bank Muscat to authorize the conversion of Iranâ€™s rials to euros through â€œany United States depository institution.â€ According to the subcommittee, Iran had $5.7 billion in assets in the Omani bank, and wanted to convert it via the U.S. financial system as it was the most efficient means, â€œeven though U.S. sanctions prohibited it,â€ according to the report. The report says that government officials said in subsequent testimony to Congress, though, that Iran would not be granted access to the financial system. OBAMA ADMIN ALLEGEDLY GAVE IRAN ACCESS TO US FINANCIAL SYSTEM The report found that the plan failed only when the two U.S. banks refused to participate, citing the complexity and the unwanted appearance involved in processing an Iranian transaction. By itself, the Obama Treasury Department&aposs issuing of a license to allow Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman was not illegal. If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system. But the Senate report revived criticism of how the Obama administration sought to accommodate Iran in connection with the nuclear deal. Trump suggested Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should be looking at this instead of the Russia probe. â€œPerhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this &aposmatter&apos (as Comey would call it),â€ he said. â€œInvestigate!â€ Republicans have pointed to the revelation as proof that the Obama administration was ""desperate"" for the Iran deal.Â Â  Video ""The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran,"" said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the panel. But a former administration official disputed the subcommittee&aposs conclusion, saying the Treasury Department never authorized Iran to access U.S. investments or markets, conduct commercial transactions in U.S. dollars or open correspondent accounts at U.S. banks. â€œThis specific license cannot be described as â€˜granting access to the U.S. financial system,â€™â€ the former official said. â€œThis specific license was in fulfillment of JCPOA commitments to give Iran access to pools of its money held overseas. It was aimed solely to allow the movement of Iranâ€™s own funds stranded at an Omani bank into euros at a European bank, where Iran could then make use of them.â€ Fox Newsâ€™ Rich Edson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-for-probe-into-claims-obama-administration-tried-to-give-iran-access-to-us-banks,White House,Fox News,

Fox Business Network's Ashley Webster has the latest on the upcoming meeting between several world leaders. On the eve of what is expected to be a tense, in-person meeting between the leaders at the G7 summit in Quebec, President Trump publicly took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French PresidentÂ Emmanuel Macron for imposing â€œmassiveâ€ economic burdens on the United States. â€œPlease tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers,â€ Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday. â€œThe EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.â€ (Factoring in services-related trade, such as financial and legal services, the E.U.&aposs trade surplus with the U.S. is closer to $100 billion.) Trump fired off another testy tweet two hours later: ""Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesnâ€™t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy â€” hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!"" TrumpÂ  has long called on Canada Â to stop protecting its dairy farmers from U.S. competition amid ongoing efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). As those negotiations have stalled, discussions between Canada and U.S. turned more pointed. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it would no longer exempt Canada, the E.U., and Mexico from punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum, citing national security and concerns of unfairness. CANADA â€˜OVERREACTINGâ€™ TO TRUMP TARIFFS, WH ECONOMIC ADVISER SAYS The move led Canada and the E.U. to impose retaliatory measures. Canada vowed to hit the U.S. with nearly $17 billion worth of tariffs on various goods from the U.S., such as toilet paper and maple syrup, and the E.U. announced planned duties as well. Trumpâ€™s comment on Twitter sets the stage for what could be an uncomfortable confrontation over economic policy on Friday. Thatâ€™s because Trudeau and Macron are expected to reiterate their previous messaging at the G7 summit, and claim that Trumpâ€™s tariffs will hurt American workers and damage the U.S.â€™ image internationally. â€œAmerican jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,â€ TrudeauÂ  said at Parliament Hill in Ottawa Â on Thursday. â€œWhen we can underscore this, and we see that thereâ€™s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-accuses-trudeau-macron-of-imposing-massive-economic-pressures-on-us-ahead-of-g7-summit,Trade,Fox News,

         Image 2 of 2 SEOUL, South Korea â€“  The on-again, off-again meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been an emotional roller coaster for South Koreans, who now await Tuesday&aposs historic summit with both hope and doubt. The hope is that improved relations between Washington and Pyongyang will ease tensions and dispel the threat of war, which has hung over the region for more than a half-century. But having seen North Korea go back on its word in the past, such as when it broke a previous nuclear pact in 2002, South Koreans remain cautious about the sudden breeze of peace blowing across their divided peninsula. ""North Korea&aposs willingness for talks seems clear now. The problem is that we are not so sure what they ultimately want,"" said graduate student Kim Jae-hak. For him, the ideal outcome would be a formal declaration to the end the Korean War, followed by the complete denuclearization of North Korea. He warned, however, that high expectations can bring great disappointment, so Koreans should watch how things unfold. South Korea&aposs government has been careful to avoid rash comments or hasty interpretations of the seesaw developments in the lead-up to the summit in Singapore. Still, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has made negotiations with North Korea a centerpiece of his administration and has a lot riding on next week&aposs events. Moon took office in May 2017 with a pledge to seek improved relations and ultimately peace with North Korea. In April, he met the North&aposs leader, Kim Jong Un, for talks at the Demilitarized Zone dividing their countries and the two set foot in one another&aposs countries, if only for a moment. Moon&aposs patient, yet determined diplomacy has been key to setting up the Trump and Kim meeting. It was Moon who presented Trump with the initial offer of a summit with Kim. After Trump accepted and then canceled, Moon worked to get it back on track by holding another meeting with Kim. ""It is critically important for President Moon Jae-in that the Trump-Moon summit goes well,"" said John Delury, associate professor of East Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. Moon has ""staked a lot of political capital in getting the U.S. and North Korea to move together in a positive way just like the two Koreas have done."" The Singapore meeting would only be the start of a long process, Delury stressed. Reducing the threat of conflict is the initial goal, he said, which would be followed by cultural, humanitarian and economic steps. ""A successful Singapore (meeting) gives more room for President Moon and Chairman Kim Jong Un to move forward in terms of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation,"" he said. For now, Moon seems to have public backing, with a Gallup Korea survey last week measuring his approval rating at 75 percent. Office worker Kim Jung-eun said the atmosphere of dialogue was welcome after North Korea&aposs provocative run of weapons tests in 2017 pushed animosity to new heights. ""I never truly thought we were headed for another war, but there was always a lingering fear in the back of my head,"" she said. ""Thinking about where we were then, I am really thankful about the current atmosphere of peace. I hope that the process results in lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula."" The Trump-Kim summit has fueled hopes in South Korea that the two leaders may weigh a formal declaration to end the Korean War. The 1950-53 conflict ended with an armistice, but not a formal peace treaty. Some, though, think that such talk should wait. The first priority should be getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, said Im Yang-bin, a professor. ""If the issue of denuclearization becomes resolved through talks a declaration ending the war will naturally follow,"" Im said. ___ Associated Press writer Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/in-south-korea-hope-and-doubt-ahead-of-trump-kim-summit,World,Fox News,

         Image 2 of 2 SEOUL, South Korea â€“  It may be the strangest feeling in decades to descend on the Korean Peninsula â€” a wave of optimism, and not always of the cautious variety, when it comes to North Korea and its nuclear bombs. Ahead of a planned summit Tuesday in Singapore between President Donald Trump and North Korean autocrat Kim Jong Un, there has been talk of complete denuclearization, North Korea has shut down (for now) its nuclear test site, and senior U.S. and North Korean officials have shuttled between Pyongyang and Washington for meetings with Kim and Trump. The top U.S. diplomat declared that ""Chairman Kim shares the objectives with the American people"" amid talk of a grand bargain that could see North Korean disarmament met with a massive influx of outside aid. Skeptics, however â€” and that&aposs usually the default mindset for many Korea watchers â€” say there are still plenty of ways that diplomacy can implode. For decades, if a potential deal with North Korea looked too good to be true, it almost certainly was. And wasn&apost it just months ago that North Korean test-missiles filled the air and Trump and Kim were slinging threats and insults at each other? So who&aposs right? There are clues that something unprecedented is indeed happening â€” no U.S. president has met with a North Korea leader, after all. But there&aposs also a recognition that optimism at what might be a once-in-a-generation chance for peace must be tempered with a clear-eyed acknowledgement at what North Korea is aiming to get out of its turn from provocation to diplomacy. Here&aposs a closer look: ___ THE OPTIMISTS Very senior officials from the United States and South Korea have set the tone here, with a huge though indirect assist from Kim Jong Un himself. Seoul quoted the North Korean leader as saying during his recent summit with his South Korean counterpart, ""If we maintain frequent meetings and build trust with the United States and receive promises for an end to the war and a non-aggression treaty, then why would we need to live in difficulty by keeping our nuclear weapons?"" Trump and his lieutenants â€” with his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, a notable exception â€” have jumped on comments like this to frame the summit and used them to bolster their own direct, and extensive, private talks with senior North Koreans. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a longtime dove who has met twice with Kim in recent weeks, ""is putting tremendous faith in a sudden conversion of Kim Jong Un to better behavior,"" according to Robert Kelly, a political science professor at Pusan National University in Busan. This has led to ""remarkable optimism"" in the South, Kelly writes. ""Again and again when I speak on panels in South Korea now, I am the lone hawk or skeptic."" The optimists argue that since North Korea has declared itself capable of accurately targeting the entire United States with nuclear-tipped missiles â€” something many analysts think is still not quite possible â€” it&aposs now ready to turn to Kim&aposs other overwhelming concern: Bringing economic security to his impoverished nation of 25 million. To do that, Kim needs to ease crushing sanctions and somehow encourage investment. If outsiders provide enough money and security guarantees, the argument goes, the North will begin to ease its grip on its nukes. A recent analysis by Stratfor, a geopolitical analytical group, based on talks with North Korean contacts found that ""Pyongyang is genuinely serious about this dialogue. They see this as a unique opportunity in dealing with an unconventional president like Trump."" The North, according to the analysis, wants U.S. mining, mineral, IT and other investments. Kim&aposs age also resonates with optimists. He&aposs only 34 and may see diplomacy as the best way to stay in power long after Moon and Trump are gone from the scene. ___ THE PESSIMISTS In a way, these folks have it easy. Calling themselves ""realists,"" they simply need to point to all the so-called past breakthroughs that have crashed on the rocks of mistrust and acrimony. Joseph Yun, the top U.S. diplomat on North Korea policy until March, recently outlined how far apart the two sides are. Trump wants ""immediate CVID (complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization), a difficult-to-grasp phrase that would elicit eye rolls from my North Korean counterparts whenever it was mentioned during our encounters."" Kim, meanwhile, ""is focused on the survival of his regime, beginning with the recognition of his country as a legitimate state, followed by an easing of economic sanctions,"" Yun wrote. ""This mismatch between U.S. and North Korean goals has remained more or less consistent over the decades and has so far stymied all agreements that have emerged between the two sides since the first round of bilateral denuclearization negotiations in the early 1990s."" Thae Yong Ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat who defected to the South in 2016, said recently that the idea that the North will completely denuclearize is a ""fantasy."" Kim Jong Un ""will never accept a process of discarding nuclear weapons that would lead to the collapse of his absolute rule over North Korea."" Skeptics also warn about the dangers of ridiculously high expectations surrounding the summit. Jeffrey Lewis, a U.S. arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, recently titled an analysis: ""Optimism About Korea Will Kill Us All: The first step toward peace is lowering your expectations."" ""North Korea has famously broken its previous pledges,"" writes Bruce Klingner, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank and former Korea specialist at the CIA. ""Seoul and Washington must maintain sanctions against the North, and military deterrence, until Pyongyang proves it has truly altered its modus operandi. When you&aposre approaching the altar with a serial philanderer, it&aposs best to keep the divorce lawyer on speed dial."" Pessimists note that North Korea has always balked at outside nuclear inspections, at demands from outsiders to close what the U.N. calls a massive system of prison camps where dissidents are tortured and killed, and at angering a powerful military that thrives on anti-U.S. and anti-South Korean sentiment. ___ THE MIDDLE GROUND? There could be some, if Trump and Kim can compromise. Yun, the former U.S. nuclear negotiator, laid out some ""easy, immediate deliverables,"" including opening North Korea&aposs main nuclear facility to inspections and monitoring by U.N. officials. A much more difficult, but crucial, ""get"" would be a full ""declaration and accounting of all North Korean nuclear sites and fissile material."" Trump and Kim can also silence skeptics in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, Yun wrote, by producing ""a clear timeline for the ultimate goal: the disablement and dismantlement of all North Korean nuclear and ICBM facilities, material and devices."" Another, more limited result could be a North Korean agreement to freeze its missile and nuclear tests in return for U.S. sanctions relief and security assurance. In the end, some argue that this spate of unusual diplomacy should be judged less on whatever documents are signed than on the relationships that are forged. ""Summits are when leaders size each other up, for better or for worse,"" writes Robert Carlin, a frequent visitor to North Korea, both as a U.S. official and outside analyst. ""They are when every nerve strains to absorb, to calculate, to weigh. They are when leaders smile and sniff the air, when, over a glass of champagne, they gain their own impressions more vivid, more real than all the briefing papers, than all the intelligence, than all the murmurings of advisers."" ___ Foster Klug is AP&aposs bureau chief in South Korea and has covered the Koreas since 2005.

Trump has acknowledged a payment was made to Stormy Daniels in connection with a non-disclosure agreement. However, he continues to deny the affair, tweetingÂ last month that the agreement was only used ""to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair."" Stockstill is up against four other candidates vying for the Republican nomination for Oklahomaâ€™s 1st congressional district.

But last Friday, Trump announced the summit between him and Kim was back on, following a lengthy meeting with a top North Korean official in the Oval Office. During that meeting, the visiting official gave him a personal letter from Kim. Video On Thursday, Trump, for the first time, discussed the contents inside the letter. â€œThe letter was just a greeting,â€ Trump said. â€œVery nice. Perhaps I can get approval to put it out.

Samantha Bee opened Wednesday nightâ€™s episode of her TBS show, â€œFull Frontal,â€ by addressing the firestorm that erupted after last weekâ€™s show, in which she referred to Ivanka Trump as ""a feckless c---"" during a segment on immigration policy. It was the late-night comedianâ€™s first show since drawing the ire of advertisers, viewers and President Donald Trump -- and she told viewers that her insult directed at the first daughter â€œcrossed a line.â€ ""It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it,â€ Bee said. â€œThis time, I used it as an insult. I crossed a line. I regret it and I do apologize."" The former member of comedian Jon Stewart&aposs ""Daily Show"" troupe on Comedy Central acknowledged that some women â€œdonâ€™t want that word reclaimedâ€ and she didnâ€™t want â€œto inflict more pain on them.â€ But Bee, 48, mixed in some humor with her apology, saying that while her goal was to produce a â€œchallengingâ€ and â€œhonestâ€ show, â€œI never intended it to hurt anyone â€” except Ted Cruz.â€ Bee also joked that, â€œMany men were also offended by my use of the word â€” I do not care about that.â€ Video Last weekâ€™s profane insult sparked outrage from many, leading sponsors like AutoTrader and State Farm to pull their ads from the show. Both Bee and TBS issued apologies the following day, with  the network tweeting  the â€œvileâ€ comment was â€œour mistake too, and we regret it.â€ Beeâ€™s words also fired up  accusations of a politically based double standard , with critics comparing TBSâ€™s â€œnon-reactionâ€ to the Bee controversy with ABCâ€™s firing of Roseanne Barr from her namesake sitcom over a racist tweet. Barr is well known as a Trump supporter, while Bee, a liberal, has been critical of the administration. The same day as her apology, Bee received a â€œsocial changeâ€ honor from the Television Academy.  The press was blocked from attending the eventâ€™s reception  and Bee avoided the red carpet interviews before the event amid the surrounding controversy. Video In her reception speech that night, Bee again apologized, acknowledging the â€œone bad wordâ€ she used distracted from the immigration issues she intended to shed light on. â€œWe spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word, when we all should have spent the day incensed that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals,â€Â Bee said in her speech, obtained by  IndieWire . The host hit on this issue again in Wednesdayâ€™s monologue, ultimately conceding her words â€œdistractedâ€ viewers from the children affected by the administrationâ€™s juvenile immigration policy. Bee apologized to the kids, too. Video Bee concluded Wednesday night&aposs third apology by giving those who worried about â€œthe death of civilityâ€ this past week something to think about. ""I&aposm really sorry that I said that word, but you know what? Civility is just nice words,"" she said. ""Maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions."" Even after Beeâ€™s many apologies, TBS -- part of the Turner Broadcasting System conglomerate that includes CNN, TNT and other stations -- will reportedly step up its oversight of the late-night show to prevent further incidents that could scare away advertisers and draw public condemnation, a source close to the matter told  the Hollywood Reporter  Wednesday.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/samantha-bee-sorry-in-first-full-frontal-since-calling-ivanka-trump-c-word,Scandal,Fox News,
07/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,7,Associated Press,"Undeterred by Trump, asylum-seekers line up at the border","TIJUANA, Mexico â€“  Undaunted by President Donald Trump&aposs tough talk on immigration, asylum-seekers are forming unusually long lines at the Mexican border, with parents and children sleeping on cardboard in the sweltering heat and waiting for days or even weeks to present themselves to U.S. inspectors. Wait times of a few hours or longer are not uncommon at the border. But the backlogs that have developed over the past several weeks at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas â€” and people sleeping out in the open for days at a time â€” are rare. Telma Ramirez made the trip from El Salvador to seek asylum in the U.S. She arrived at the border in Tijuana with her 5-year-old son and year-old daughter, only to find a crush of others ahead of her. The 27-year-old mother kept checking in at the border crossing to see if civilian volunteers were close to calling their numbers, in a scene that resembled the host station at a crowded restaurant. Finally, on the 20th day, Ramirez made it to the front of the line. ""You must come every day to see if it&aposs your turn. If you don&apost come, you&aposll lose your place in line,"" Ramirez said. The exact reasons for the bottleneck are unclear. But the U.S. has been seeing a surge in requests for asylum over the past few years. A top Homeland Security Department official told lawmakers last month that new asylum filings tripled between 2014 and 2017 to nearly 142,000, the highest level in more than 20 years. The official, Francis Cissna, director or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the asylum backlog stood at 318,000 cases. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that any waits in Mexico are expected to be temporary. It said the number of people the agency can take depends on such factors as detention space, complexity of cases, translation requirements, medical needs and traffic at the crossing. Some advocates insist the administration has enough resources to avoid the delays and is dragging its feet to discourage people from trying to come across. The Trump administration has declared a new ""zero-tolerance"" policy of prosecuting every immigrant arrested for illegal entry, a practice that is separating parents from their children. Asylum-seekers who turn themselves in to border inspectors usually do not face such a fate. At the Hidalgo, Texas, border crossing, parents and children sleep on cardboard on a bridge separating the two countries, waiting for U.S. authorities to signal their time has come, according to volunteers bringing them food and water. Lawyers said asylum-seekers at the Nogales, Arizona, crossing are camping out for up for five days to make a claim. Across from San Diego, more than 100 asylum-seekers gathered Monday in a large plaza at the Tijuana side of the nation&aposs busiest border crossing, alongside pushcart vendors selling oatmeal, tamales, burritos and smoothies. Families whose numbers aren&apost called return to Tijuana migrant shelters to pass the time. Volunteer Carlos Salio told them the wait is about three weeks. Salio consulted his tattered notebook of people who left their names with him, calling them out when their turn came. When U.S. authorities said 50 would be allowed to claim asylum that day, Salio encouraged people to go back to their shelters. ""Everyone knows that when your number is close, you better be here,"" he told the crowd, many of them women with young children. Separately, in another indication that Trump&aposs hardline actions and rhetoric have had limited effect, the administration said Wednesday that border arrests topped 50,000 for a third straight month in May. That is roughly three times what they were a year earlier and higher than the levels seen during much of the Obama administration. It is not uncommon for asylum-seekers to have to wait. A caravan of Central Americans who provoked Trump&aposs anger earlier this spring waited nearly a week. The recent waits have not reached levels seen in 2016, when thousands of Haitians overwhelmed border inspectors in San Diego and had to bide their time for up to five weeks. Under federal law and international treaties, people can obtain asylum in the U.S. if they have a well-grounded fear of persecution back home. Trump administration officials and their allies have charged that the system is rife with fraud and groundless claims and have demanded stricter standards. Senior White House aide Stephen Miller said last month that the integrity of the immigration system is ""completely shattered"" and legitimate asylum cases have become ""a needle in a haystack."" About 8 of every 10 asylum-seekers pass an initial screening and are then either held in an immigration detention center or released on bond into the U.S. while their cases wind through immigration courts, which can take years. Many asylum claims are eventually denied. In Texas&apos Rio Grande Valley, people have been seen waiting on the bridge at Hidalgo for at least two weeks, according to witnesses and news reports. One volunteer, Esperanza Chandler, said Friday that families have been told by U.S. authorities that there&aposs no room to process them. ""Where they are, the sun hits them all day long,"" Chandler said. ""They&aposre under a little bit of covering, but the concrete and that whole area is very, very hot."" Volunteers brought umbrellas to provide some shade. To keep order in Tijuana, activists created a system in which asylum-seekers give their names and are then issued numbers, ensuring that people who arrive after them won&apost jump ahead. Mexicans dominated the list of asylum-seekers waiting to cross in San Diego. There were also large numbers of Central Americans. Blanca Estela Garcia, 31, said she fled the violent Mexican state of Michoacan because a neighbor had been kidnapped and she received a death threat. She didn&apost know where she would go with her husband and children ages 14, 8 and 1 if they were allowed into the U.S. ""The important thing is not to go back,"" she said. After spending her first night in Tijuana on the concrete outside the border crossing, she was given a number and planned to look for shelter for the next few weeks. ___ Merchant reported from Houston.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/undeterred-by-trump-asylum-seekers-line-up-at-the-border,US,Fox News,

President Trump drew inspiration from Alanis Morissette early Thursday in his latest slam against the Russia probe, asking ""isn&apost it ironic"" that the investigation is ramping up amid high-stakes summits on trade and nuclear weapons. â€œIsnâ€™t it Ironic? Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea & the Nuclear Problemâ€¦But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt!â€ Trump tweeted. He added, ""When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?"" As with the original hit song, the meaning of ""ironic"" has perhaps been lost a bit. But the president was making the case that his administration is pursuing important work while the Russia probe looms over the team. The president is slated to attend the G-7 summit starting Friday in Quebec. Leaders from France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. will meet in Charlevoix to discuss a host of issuesâ€”such as climate change and the Paris accord, which Trump pulled out of last year; the Iran nuclear deal, which he scrapped last month; and North Korea. The G-7 is taking place just days after the president slapped tariffs on allies in the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Trump announced in March that he was imposing tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, but he temporarily granted a waiver to U.S allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union, and also to China, as his administration said trade talks were continuing. Trump ended that temporary relief this month, seeking to pressure the other countries to cut new trade agreements with the U.S. Japan was never granted a waiver, despite Prime Mininster Shinzo Abe&aposs pleas. Abe is meeting with Trump on Thursday in Washington. Trump is also slated to have a series of one-on-one meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron. Just days later, the president is expected to travel to Singapore for the highly anticipated summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That meeting is scheduled to take place on June 12 at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island. Last month, the president nixed the U.S.-North Korea summit following threatening language from Kim and his rogue regime. But last week, former North Korean military intelligence official Kim Yong Chol, who had a series of meetings in New York City with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, traveled to the White House to meet with Trump, and hand-deliver a letter from Kim. After the Oval Office meeting, Trump told reporters the June 12 meeting was back on, calling the conversation with Kim Yong Chol a â€œgreat start.â€ Trump, meanwhile, continues to slam Robert Muellerâ€™s special counsel investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election. The probe has cost taxpayers more than $17 million, according to recent figures. The â€œ13 Angry Democratsâ€ Trump mentioned Thursday were in reference to Democrats on Muellerâ€™s team -- which includes 17 total investigators. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican. The phrase may also be a reference to the 1957 film ""12 Angry Men,"" in which a group of jurors nearly convict a teenager before reversing course.

They want to make a â€˜plea dealâ€™ to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!â€ Awan, who worked for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and other Democrats, has not been charged with any crimes related to his official duties in Congress. But  Philip G. Kiko, the chief administrative officer of the House, said in April  that the Houseâ€™s inspector general â€œdiscovered evidence of procurement fraud and irregularitiesâ€ and â€œnumerous violations of House security policiesâ€ by Awan and other IT employees connected to him. The case against Awan has drawn the interest of the president and other Republicans, who have suggested Awan could have been involved in a cyber breach operation. Awanâ€™s legal team has vigorously denied these allegations. In court, Awan and his wife are facing allegations they engaged in a conspiracy to obtain home equity lines of credit from the Congressional Federal Credit Union by giving false information about two properties â€“ and sending the proceeds to individuals in Pakistan. Democrats waived background checks for IT aides Over 40 Democrats chose not to vet House IT aides. 'Daily Caller' investigative reporter, Luke Rosiak, on what he discovered. AWAN POISED FOR PLEA DEAL, AFTER MONTHS OF MYSTERIOUS DELAYS A court filing this week said a plea agreement hearing for Awan and his wife Hina Alvi has been set for July 3 before U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan in Washington. The filing did not reveal any details about the terms of the apparent agreement. But in court documents last month, prosecutors hinted that a deal could be in the works. â€œThe parties are currently exploring a possible resolution of this matter,â€ prosecutors wrote. â€œTherefore, the parties are requesting additional time in which to explore that resolution.â€ Awanâ€™s attorney, Christopher J. Gowen, nevertheless kept the door open Wednesday to the possibility that a deal might not be finalized. â€œA plea happens in court,â€ Gowen said in an email to Fox News. â€œA plea does not happen outside of court. We anticipate that by July 3rd we will either enter a plea or the case will be set for trial.â€ A grand jury in August returned an indictment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Awan and Alvi with a total of four counts pertaining to that alleged scheme, which included federal bank fraud and conspiracy. Awan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Trump has tweeted about the case and referred to Awan as â€œthe Pakistani mystery man.â€ Trump also mentioned Awan in a New York Times story last year, saying, â€œWhatever happened to this Pakistani guy who worked with the DNC?â€ Awan and other IT aides for House Democrats originally had been on investigatorsâ€™ radar for months over concerns of alleged equipment theft, access to sensitive computer systems and more, according to reports dating back to early 2017. Awan was born in Pakistan, but came to the U.S. with his family when he was a teenager. He became a U.S. citizen more than a decade ago. The broader case surrounding him also has put renewed scrutiny on Wasserman Schultz for keeping Awan on the payroll for months, even after a criminal investigation was revealed and he was barred from the House IT network. Most lawmakers fired Awan in February 2017, but Wasserman Schultz kept him on until his arrest in July.

Kaepernickâ€™s lawyers hope to dive into the White Houseâ€™s political involvement with the league during the quarterbackâ€™s free agency and the leagueâ€™s handling of player protests,Â  Yahoo Sports Â reported Thursday, citing sources with knowledge of the collusion case. The former San Francisco 49ers star will have to jump through another set of hoops while trying to get the White House involved in its case. According to Yahoo, Kaepernickâ€™s legal team will have to convince the system arbitrator overseeing the grievance case that Trump, Pence and othersâ€™ testimony would be relevant and make an impact on the case. If the arbitrator grants the request, the lawyers will then have to seek the subpoenas in a district court under the Federal Arbitration Act. Should both hurdles be cleared, it could call into question whether Trump, and others, could be forced to sit for depositions. The latest development in the Kaepernick grievance case comes more than a week after it was revealed Trumpâ€™s public and personal pressure on NFL owners played a big role in the leagueâ€™s decision to change its national anthem rules amid controversial player protests. In depositions by NFL owners obtained byÂ  The Wall Street Journal , Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones revealed that Trump personally told him â€œyou canâ€™t win this one.â€ Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross reportedly said he thought Trump â€œchanged the dialogue.â€ He reportedly added that he was supportive of the playersâ€™ protests until Trumpâ€™s comments. Kaepernick was the first NFL player to protest police violence and racial injustice by refusing to stand for the national anthem in 2016.

          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly wants to stay at the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore.
           (AP) The North Korean regime is notorious for being miserly when it comes to reaching for the check, a fact that is complicating logistics in a big way for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. The historic meeting is slated for June 12 at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island in Singapore, following weeks of back and forth between the U.S. and North Korea over whether negotiations to wind down the regime&aposs nuclear program would actually take place. Trump voiced confidence Thursday, saying: â€œThis will not be just a photo op.â€ â€œIf they do not denuclearize, that will not be acceptable,â€ he said during anÂ Oval Office meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, adding, â€œItâ€™s gonna be a very fruitful meeting.â€ But the question of who will foot the bill for accommodations for North Korea has garnered attention, amid signals that the cash-strapped Hermit Kingdom wonâ€™t pay for lodging for its own delegation to the talks. The comp expectation has presented somewhat of a diplomatic dilemma.Â A recentÂ  Washington Post Â report said the regime requires that a foreign country pay its accommodation costs, and suggested the U.S. was in talks to find a discreet way to foot the hotel bill. 
      The Trump-Kim summit is slated to take place at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island in Singapore.
       (AP) But the Trump administration now says the U.S. government is not going to cover those costs. â€œWe are not paying for their travel,â€ White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News on Thursday. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also confirmed this week that the U.S. is not paying for accommodation costs for the North Korean delegation in Singapore. So who is? This is no stay at the Hampton. Kim reportedly is seeking to lodge at the Fullerton Hotel, near the Singapore River. A presidential suite costs approximately $6,000 per night. Video This week, Sanders also said that the U.S. was not asking any other country to help fund the North Korean delegationâ€™s trip. Over the weekend, though, Singaporeâ€™s Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen reportedly said they were â€œwilling to bearâ€ some costs â€œto play a small part in this historic meeting.â€ And U.S.-based hotel company HotelPlanner told Fox News on Thursday that it also offered to pay for accommodations for the North Korean delegation, but noted they have not made direct contact with Pyongyang. â€œWe faxed the invitation to the North Korean consulate in China, but they have yet to respond,â€ a spokesperson for HotelPlanner told Fox News Thursday.  HotelPlanner CEO Tim Hentschel told Fox News that his company is â€œqualifiedâ€ to pay for the arrangements. â€œWe think itâ€™s the right thing to do. We can help and we want to help,â€ Hentschel told Fox News. â€œObviously this is a very important step to world peace.â€ Hentschel said he anticipated the cost for lodging, food and beverage for the delegation to be approximately $100,000. Video â€œWeâ€™re comfortable with that,â€ Hentschel said, noting that while they would rather work with existing HotelPlanner hotel partners, the company would be willing to accommodate Kim at his desired Fullerton Hotel. â€œWe havenâ€™t heard back from them yet, but if thatâ€™s what they want to do, then weâ€™ll initiate the talks with the Fullerton,â€ Hentschel said. While Pyongyang has not outright said it will not pay for its own delegationâ€™s lodging at the summit, the regime has a history of being stingy when it comes time to pay. Most recently, during the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea  reportedly  spent $2.6 million to pay for the North Korean delegation&aposs attendance, and the International Olympics Committee reportedly paid for 22 North Korean athletes to travel to the games. Back in 2014, during the Obama administration, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper traveled to North Korea, and  reportedly  was served an â€œelaborate 12-course Korean mealâ€ by his North Korean hosts, but then was asked to pay for it.

07/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,7,Samuel Chamberlain,House approves bill to cancel $15B in spending at Trump's request,"
          House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, center, was a prominent supporter of the so-called 'recissions' package
           (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) The House narrowly approved a White House plan to cut $15 billion in previously allocated government money late Thursday, a mostly symbolic move designed to demonstrate fiscal discipline in Washington. The so-called ""recissions"" package was passed by a vote of 210-206, with 19 Republicans joining 187 Democrats in opposing the measure. The legislation was embraced by conservative Republicans upset by the March passage of a $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill that they say was too bloated. More pragmatic Republicans on Capitol Hill&aposs powerful Appropriations panels aren&apost keen on the measure since it would eliminate accounting tricks they routinely use to pay for spending elsewhere. The measure includes $4 billion in cuts to a defunct loan program designed to boost fuel-efficient, advanced-technology vehicles, rescissions of various agriculture grant programs, and cuts to conservation programs at the Department of Agriculture, among others. ""By voting to rescind these billions in unspent funds, the House supports President Trump&aposs efforts to eliminate wasteful spending and get our fiscal house back in order,"" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in a statement. ""The first of several recissions proposals, President Trump is using every tool at his disposal to put taxpayers first and drain the swamp."" While Democrats blasted the cuts, the real objection to some of them, such as $7 billion from popular Children&aposs Health Insurance Program funding, is that it would take that money off the table so it couldn&apost be used later as it was in the earlier spending bill. The CHIP cuts wouldn&apost affect enrollment in the program, which provides health care to children from low-income families that don&apost qualify for Medicaid. ""Targeting CHIP for a rescission prevents Congress from reinvesting in other priorities like child and maternal health, early childhood education, biomedical research and our community health centers,"" said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. Some GOP moderates also worry that they&aposre casting a difficult-to-explain vote to cut CHIP funding in the run-up to November&aposs midterm elections. ""I don&apost think the vote&aposs intended for people in swing districts,"" said Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office weighed in Thursday to estimate that the measure â€” pushed largely by Mulvaney and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. â€” would only cut the deficit by $1.1 billion over the coming decade. That&aposs because most of the cuts wouldn&apost affect the deficit at all since CBO doesn&apost give deficit credit for cutting money that would never have been spent. Trump proposed the measure last month, but it was slow to come to a vote because some Republicans came out against it. The White House submitted a revised package of cuts Tuesday, removing politically troublesome proposals to cut money to fight Ebola funds and to rebuild watersheds damaged by Superstorm Sandy. Trump weighed in soon after to urge Republicans to pass the plan. The measure is unlikely to go anywhere in the Senate, where pragmatic-minded Republicans are focusing on trying to get the troubled process for handling annual appropriations back on track on a bipartisan basis. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told Fox News Monday that ""I&aposve not been a big fan of the recissions package."" The White House and tea party lawmakers upset by the budget-busting ""omnibus"" bill have rallied around the plan, aiming to show that Republicans are taking on out-of-control spending. ""If this body cannot be trusted to reclaim money that will not or cannot be used for its intended purpose, can we really be trusted to save money anywhere else?"" McCarthy said. While some Democrats opposed the spending cuts as heartless, others mostly mocked the legislation. ""After spending nearly $2 trillion on tax cuts for the super-rich and blowing up the deficit, the Majority&aposs bill is like putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. ""Republicans are trying to trick the American people into thinking they care about fiscal responsibility. They&aposre not fooling anyone.""

 President Trump said this week that he has the right to pardon himself from possible crimes related to Russian meddling into the 2016 elections. â€œI have the absolute right to PARDON myself,â€ the president tweeted. He then quickly assured us that he wouldnâ€™t use that power. â€œBut why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?â€ the president asked, taking the position that he has no need to pardon himself. He further tweeted that the Russia probe being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is â€œUNCONSTITUTIONAL.â€ President Trumpâ€™s comments followed arguments made over the weekend by his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, who is the former mayor of New York City and a former U.S. attorney for New York. Giuliani said the Constitution allows the president to pardon himself. â€œHe has no intention of pardoning himself."" Giuliani told ABC News, referring to President Trump. â€œIt would be an open question. I think it would probably get answered by gosh, that&aposs what the Constitution says, and if you want to change it, change it. But yes.â€ A group of prominent lawyers, including Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School and former White House ethics czar Norm Eisen, immediately fired back. â€œThe Office of the President is not a get-out-of-jail free card for lawless behavior,â€ the lawyers wrote in a group letter. â€œOur Founders would not have created â€“ and did not create â€“ a Constitution that would permit the President to use his powers to violate the laws for corrupt and self-interested reasons.â€ This time, Trump and Giuliani have the better of the chattering class. Article II of the Constitution declares that the president â€œshall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in cases of Impeachment.â€ A careful reading of the plain text shows that the framers made only two exceptions to the pardon power. First, the president cannot issue pardons for state crimes, only violations of federal law. Second, the president cannot issue pardons for impeachment. The constitutional text contains no other limitations on the presidential pardon power, and the Supreme Court, as recently as 1974, has never attempted to impose one. Historical evidence from the Constitutionâ€™s framing cannot overcome the plain meaning of the constitutional text â€“ if anything, it supports this textual reading. To be sure, the 1787-88 debate in the states over whether to adopt the Constitution did not extensively discuss the pardon power. But in the main guide to the Constitutionâ€™s meaning offered by its supporters, The Federalist Papers, gave two reasons for the pardon power. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 74, the Constitution creates a pardon power â€œout of humanity and good policyâ€ to allow for â€œmitigation from the rigour of the law.â€ In other words, the president can issue pardons when the law produces harsh or absurd results, such as a small-time thief who, under a three-strikes law, might go to jail for life for stealing a pizza. Mercy has propelled most of the pardons issued by presidents in our history. Foreshadowing the attack of modern Trump critics, opponents of executive power argued that the president might misuse the power to pardon his co-conspirators in a treason plot. During the Philadelphia Convention, which drafted the Constitution for state approval, Virginia Gov. Edmund Randolph proposed that a third exclusion from pardons join those for state crimes and impeachments: prosecutions for treason. Randolph argued that â€œthe prerogative of pardon in these cases was too great a trust. The President may himself be guilty. The Traytors may be his own instruments.â€ James Wilson responded: â€œPardon is necessary for cases of treason, and is best placed in the hands of the Executive.â€ Wilson, however, suggested that a president could still be prosecuted for treason. â€œIf he be himself a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted.â€ Â Randolphâ€™s motion lost by 8 states to 2. In publicly responding to Randolphâ€™s claim when the Constitution went to the states for ratification, Hamilton provided a second, broader justification for the pardon power and rejected limits on its self-dealing use. According to Hamilton in Federalist 74, the anti-Federalists argued that â€œthe connivance of the chief magistrate ought not to be entirely excludedâ€ in cases of treason. They demanded instead that the Constitution give Congress the power to pardon. Hamilton refused to accept a limit on the pardon power, even for those who conspire with the president, even for the president himself. Instead, Hamilton explained that an unfettered pardon power could be critical to ending public disorder or civil war. â€œIn seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth,â€ Hamilton wrote. Only the president, Hamilton argued, could act vigorously in times of crisis and use pardons to â€œrestore the tranquility of the commonwealth.â€ Hamiltonâ€™s argument on the pardon power advanced his core thesis that the Constitution must concentrate the executive power in a single person, the president, so that the nation could act with decisiveness, speed and energy. Hamiltonâ€™s wisdom undoubtedly served the nation well during the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln used not only the executive power to respond energetically to the existential threat of secession, but also used the pardon power to begin the process of national healing. The benefits of such a power, Hamilton believed, outweighed the possibilities that a future president might use pardons to corruptly benefit himself. Attempts to read an anti-self-dealing principle into the pardon power, where none appears in the text, are incorrect. They amount to the type of judicial activism that has undermined the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and does violence to the process for democratic self-government written into the Constitution. But just because President Trump has the constitutional power to pardon himself, prudence and political tradition urge him against using it. If President Trump believes that Mueller is acting improperly, the remedy is to fire Mueller, not to preemptively pardon himself and everyone subject to the investigation. Indeed, a self-pardon could rise to the level of a â€œhigh Crime and misdemeanorâ€ sufficient to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Impeachment remains the Constitutionâ€™s mechanism for punishing, in Hamiltonâ€™s words, â€œthe misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.â€ If President Trump were to use the pardon power for himself, even if constitutionally possible, he could provide Congress the grounds it needs to remove him from office.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-the-power-to-pardon-himself-but-that-could-get-him-impeached,OPINION,Fox News,

Bush, and Dave Brown, Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to Sen. Patty Murray. President Trump on Thursday took a swipe at Republican foe Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, accusing him of being â€œhumiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seatâ€ and making a play on his name. Flake  said  last month that while itâ€™s â€œnot in my plansâ€ to run in 2020 against Trump, he has not ruled it out. Trump appeared to be responding to that in his tweet Thursday when he asked how Flake could consider running for office considering his â€œrecord low polling numbersâ€ and adding that he was â€œforcedâ€ to retire. â€œHow could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesnâ€™t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again?â€ he asked. â€œLetâ€™s face it, heâ€™s a Flake!â€ he added. Trump and Flake, who is retiring after the midterm elections,, have long thrown barbs at one another. Last month the moderate senator  said  that the â€œpresidency has been debasedâ€ by Trump and accused him of having a â€œbottomless appetite for destruction and division.â€ Flake has stepped into the role of Trump critic from within the Republican Party. Last year he released a book: â€œConscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.â€ Recently he has been a vocal opponent of Trumpâ€™s tariffs on aluminium and steel imports, as well as voting against Trumpâ€™s pick for CIA nominee, Gina Haspel. Flakeâ€™s barbs have been so intense that they have sometimes drawn criticism from GOP leadership. In January, Flake  accused  Trump of using Stalinist language and promoting global instability with his criticism of the media. â€œIt is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies,â€ he said. â€˜Comparing the leader of the free world to murderous dictators is absurd,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted in response.

07/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,7,Andrew Napolitano,"Judge Andrew Napolitano: Rudy Giulianiâ€™s hypothetical question about Comey hurts, not helps, Trump","close Video Judge Nap: Why President Trump is not above the law Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano explains how the president is not above the law after Rudy Giuliani's colorful hypothetical that Trump wouldn't be indicted even if he shot James Comey in the White House. Last weekend, the White House leaked a copy of a letter sent by President Donald Trump&aposs legal team on Jan. 29 to special counsel Robert Mueller. The letter set forth the president&aposs legal strategy, arguing essentially that he is immune from prosecution for any crime. To soften the tone of this poorly received letter, the White House dispatched Rudy Giuliani, the president&aposs most visible legal spokesperson, to address the issues that his colleagues had raised. He made matters worse when he suggested that if the president ordered Jim Comey ""shot in the Oval Office,"" he couldn&apost be prosecuted because the president can pardon himself and because the president&aposs personal and presidential behavior is beyond the reach of the criminal justice system. Giuliani was supposed to be making a principled case for why the president cannot be subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, and he ended up discussing absurd hypotheticals about a self-pardon and shooting the former FBI director in the White House. Here is the back story. Trump&aposs lawyers&apos letter argued that obstruction of justice refers to interference with a judicial proceeding and that an FBI investigation is not a judicial proceeding. That was the law before 2002, but an amendment adopted that year provided that any corrupt interference with an FBI investigation that is aimed at producing evidence for a grand jury constitutes obstruction of justice. The letter&aposs second argument offered that Trump could not have committed obstruction of justice because he controls all that is done in the executive branch and decides what is just, whom to prosecute and whom to overlook. This is the Nixonian argument that ""when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal,"" which was rejected by the lessons of Watergate. The president is not a king. He took an oath to uphold the Constitution. That includes the rule of law. The rule of law has three unassailable elements. 1) No one is beneath the law&aposs protections. 2) No one is above the law&aposs requirements. 3) No one can be a prosecutor or judge in his own case. The Giuliani argument over the weekend that Trump could have Comey shot in the Oval Office with impunity is not only needlessly tasteless and patently absurd but also contrary to the rule of law, and it is an invitation to presidential lawlessness. In Giuliani&aposs hypothetical, Trump would be arrested for murder if Comey died. He would be indicted for murder, but he would not be tried until his term in office is complete. That&aposs because the judicial system must respect the president&aposs prerogatives of office while he is in office. If Trump fired Comey as FBI director because he couldn&apost stand to be in a room with a guy taller than he is, Trump committed no wrong. But if he fired Comey because he wanted to stop the Russia investigation -- which is essentially what he told NBC News&apos Lester Holt -- that was using the machinery of the presidency for a corrupt purpose, which is the essence of obstruction. The president can be charged with obstruction anytime a grand jury finds probable cause of his guilt, but just as in the Giuliani shooting hypothetical, he cannot be tried until the day after he leaves office. The Trump team letter committed a third error by failing to address United States v. Nixon, a 1974 Supreme Court case that addressed subpoenas to the president. The Nixon case makes clear that the president enjoys broad and wide executive privilege -- the ability to keep presidential documents and testimony away from Congress and the courts -- in his ordinary work. But the Nixon case also makes clear that executive privilege is reduced radically in a criminal investigation. If subpoenaed in that context, the president must surrender documents and give testimony on all relevant matters demanded by the prosecutors, except for military secrets, diplomatic secrets and sensitive national security matters. None of those pertains to Mueller&aposs likely subpoena to Trump, and Giuliani knows that. Can the president pardon himself? The short answer is: No one knows. The longer answer is: Why would the president&aposs lawyer be offering this argument? The president has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, so why discuss pardoning oneself? The president&aposs pardoning power has no limits in the Constitution. Yet the rule-of-law principle that one cannot be the prosecutor or judge in one&aposs own case suggests that the president&aposs pardoning power is limited to people other than himself. It is hard for me to believe that a court confronted with an indictment of Trump would dismiss it in deference to Trump&aposs self-pardon. After Giuliani offered his views on a presidential self-pardon and a presidential shooting, the president jumped into the fray and tweeted that he can pardon himself; and by the way, the United States Office of Special Counsel is unconstitutional. I was shocked to see that opinion because that office is authorized by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which Congress adopted and has been validated by six federal judges. Moreover, the president himself sanctioned Russian intelligence agents that one of the special counsel&aposs grand juries indicted. If that office is unconstitutional, why are the president&aposs lawyers interacting with it? I am unhappily surprised and deeply disappointed by the poor quality of public lawyering in Trump&aposs behalf that we have seen thus far. The Jan. 29 letter would have flunked a law school course in criminal procedure. The Giuliani hysterics have substantially diminished the professional reputation of one of the country&aposs more formidable ex-prosecutors, have offered known untruths and have become the legal equivalent of throwing gasoline on a fire. None of this is good for Donald Trump, whose legal woes continue to grow in spite of his legal team&aposs efforts to minimize them.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-rudy-giulianis-hypothetical-question-about-comey-hurts-not-helps-trump,OPINION,Fox News,

Alice Marie Johnson, the woman whose life sentence was commuted by President Trump this week, promised the commander in chief:Â â€œI will make you proud.â€ Johnson, 63, had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole after she was convicted of a first-time nonviolent drug offense and charges related to money laundering. Reality TV iconÂ Kim Kardashian West took up her case, even meeting with Trump at the White House to plead for clemency. In an interview Thursday night with Fox Newsâ€™ Martha MacCallum  on â€œThe Story,â€  Johnson expressed her gratitude for Trump&aposs decision the day before to commute her sentence. â€œThank you so much President Trump for taking the time to look at my case and to really look at me,â€ she said. â€œI promise you President Trump, I will make you proud that you gave me that second chance.â€ Video Johnson spent 22 years in prison, a third of her life, and said that it was her faith and her optimism that allowed her to carry on. â€œThe only way that I was able to make it through that time, and this is the truth, was my faith in God.â€ She said she knew that one day, â€œHe was going to bring me out.â€ Johnson continued, â€œI lived my life with an eye toward one day walking out of those doors a free woman and the day that I got the news that President Trump had granted my clemency and given me a second chance at life was the best day of my life.â€ 
      Johnson was put on the presidentâ€™s radar during a meeting in the Oval Office last week with Kardashian West, who was originally slated to meet with Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to discuss prison reform.
       The events leading up to Johnson&aposs offenses included divorce and the loss of her job at Fedex. It was desperation that forced her hand. â€œDonâ€™t make a permanent decision that can change your life forever based on a temporary situation,â€ she said looking back at her past. â€œIt was not worth itâ€¦ It changed the course of my life.â€ Johnson said that now that sheâ€™s free, she wants to fight hard for prison reform, including making sure people incarcerated are ready to rejoin society when their â€œmiracleâ€ does come. Johnson said that itâ€™s finally â€œstarting to set in that Iâ€™m truly free.â€ She revealed, â€œIâ€™m so happy, nothing bothers me.â€ Fox Newsâ€™ Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.

This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" June 7, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The summit is all ready to go, subject always to change. You never know in this world.  I think I very well prepared. I don&apost like I have to prepare very much. It&aposs about attitude. It&aposs about willingness to get things done. This will be at a minimum, we&aposll start with perhaps a good relationship, and that&aposs something that&aposs very important toward the ultimate making of the deal.  SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: The complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the only outcome that we will find acceptable. And North Korea has confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearize.  (END VIDEO CLIPS) SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS: So pretty much everyone agrees that&aposs not going to happen on June 12th. Let&aposs bring our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief for The Weekly Standard; David Catanese, senior politics writer for U.S. News and World Report, and Matt Schlapp, contributor with The Hill. Gentlemen, welcome to all of you.  Steve, I&aposll start with you. The president&aposs statement, I don&apost think I have to prepare very much, people are jumping on that. But he&aposs always talked about the relational aspect of the negotiations. He&aposs not traditional about the way he&aposs handled this but it seems like he&aposs move the ball further than just about any other U.S. president.  STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It depends on how you look at it. The Bush administration went out of its way not to have not have face-to-face bilateral meetings with North Korea. And the time that it did, Christopher Hill who was the envoy did it without telling Condoleezza Rice at first because it was thought to be such a concession to the North Koreans. So he has given a lot because he&aposs having the meetings.  And I think the kinds of comments the president is making have not been helpful. He deserves credit for changing the failed policy of the previous three administrations, no doubt about it. Different conversation. We are not outsourcing to China. That&aposs helpful. The things he&aposs saying now, that he doesn&apost need to prepare, the North Korea is committed to denuclearization, that this has been an open and honorable process, those things I think are not helpful. We should be clear with the North Koreans that they will denuclearize, we will verify it, it will be irreversible, and that&aposs it. They have an opportunity to do this. This is their only opportunity to do it or we&aposre walking away and they&aposre in trouble.  BREAM: David, that&aposs what he continued to say today. I will walk out at any point when I don&apost think we&aposre actually going to get to that goal.  DAVID CATANESE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT: Look at far we&aposve come. Last year he was calling him little rocket man and threatening their annihilation, and then today he said yes, we&aposll have him over to the White House and have a powwow. So look, a week could go by. He could have this summit and he can decide he&aposs never going to deal with him again frankly.  I think the one interesting aspect that I&aposm focused on more is that we are not hearing as much about what North Korea gets out of this. What do they want out of it? And I think that is going to be a standard by which to measure this. We know what we want -- denuclearization. Pompeo said it today very clearly. What do they want? Are they just using Trump as a prop to stand next to? And how do we know what they want coming out of the meeting?  BREAM: The president talked about the economic benefit that he&aposs hoping to get them all situated with, with China, with South Korea, with others he says has stepped up, but it sounds like, Matt, that&aposs the part of the equation that they want and that they desperately need.  MATT SCHLAPP, THE HILL: What President Trump deserves a lot of credit for this ultimate pressure campaign. The idea that China believed that the president of the United States was serious.  The second issue is that by a lot a people&aposs accounts, the Kims are out of money, or they are running out of money. They are in a different situation than they were in before. They actually need to have this go better because they have to have the spigot for the resources from China and other places get turned on again. So I&aposm very hopeful. I actually am very hopeful that the president will walk away if it&aposs a bad deal.  He doesn&apost have to do this immediately. If they need America&aposs help and they need America to take the pressure off China, then he&aposs got to get to a deal. And they&aposve got to get to a deal. I&aposm happy we have a president who likes this kind of process. I think it actually plays to his strength. I&aposm not that worried that he will walk away from a bad deal. If he walks away from Singapore, the negotiations, I&aposm going to be good with it because I know we&aposre going to go to step two.  BREAM: OK, let&aposs see what the folks out there across America think. We have brand new FOX News polling. And there is one question, President Trump and Kim Jong-un meeting, who would get the better deal? Forty percent say Donald Trump, 30 percent say Kim Jong-un, 17 percent say neither or the same, 12 percent unsure. So Steve, at least the folks who answered this poll, the biggest number of them, the plurality of them think that if these two do sit down and go head and head, they have more confidence in our president.  HAYES: I hope they are right. The Kims have won with three previous American presidents I would say, and every time we have sat down with them, they have been broke. They&aposve been on the verge of going broke. And one of the things that&aposs given them lifelines again and again and again is U.S. concessions, preemptive U.S. concessions. We have offered them time and again for promises of denuclearization. They haven&apost denuclearized obviously or we wouldn&apost be having these conversations.  I don&apost think China has been necessarily a good partner in this. I think China has been an uneven partner. They have put pressure on. At times it&aposs been helpful. They have also restarted flights or announced that they&aposre going to restart flights between Beijing and Pyongyang. We also have the Syrian question which I think is a pretty significant question. North Korean state TV announces that Bashar al-Assad, the history of proliferation between North Korea and Syria, wants a meeting and will potentially be getting a meeting with Kim Jong-un. That is an obvious provocative step here. If North Korea were truly committed to bettering relations with the United States and the civilized world, they wouldn&apost be doing things like that less than two weeks before this meeting.  BREAM: You&aposre itching, Matt. SCHLAPP: Yes, I&aposm just going to say, the people I talked to, I dial back into my former Bush administration colleagues from the NSC and other places, and they do believe they are in a financial situation like they&aposve never been in before and the situation with China is different. And I think the dynamics, Trump deserves some of that credit for the change in the dynamics, but he also gets some of the benefit from the fact that the dynamics are different than they&aposve ever been before. So I think this is a unique moment in history.  CATANESE: It&aposs hard to believe denuclearization is what they are going to agree to. I think the comments from the president --  SCHLAPP: Then they&aposre not getting a deal. CATANESE: But how do we know? And are there steps in place? He is saying I don&apost need to prepare. It&aposs all attitude. You&aposve got to lay out, what are the deliverables out of this meeting that you are going to get from him, not just their word, but are you going to be able to go around their country, find where their nuclear weapons are? Are you come to an agreement on monitors? Is he just going to trust that Kim Jong-un&aposs word, and then what happens after that?  BREAM: I can&apost imagine they get to that level of detail in this first meeting, so maybe it is about the relational aspect of trying to get to those.  SCHLAPP: Just quickly remember what John Bolton did at the State Department. He did arms control. And I am so appreciative that he is there. I guarantee that he&aposs going to be in the president&aposs ear every single moment and is making sure we can do exactly what you described.  HAYES: But it&aposs important, just on the preparation question, it&aposs important for a world leader, particularly the leader of the world&aposs superpower, to go into a meeting knowing the history of these negotiations, knowing the history of the relationship so that when he hears something that&aposs been said time and again, he&aposs not hearing it for the first time and it&aposs not tempted to believe something that has been the basis of lies for three decades. That&aposs a concern.  BREAM: Does it reassure you or worry you that Ambassador Bolton is part of the team, prepping him and getting them ready?  HAYES: I have said here before, I will say again I am happy that John Bolton is on one side of Donald Trump. I&aposm happy that Mike Pompeo is on the other side of Donald Trump.  BREAM: And the president tweeting today up a storm today, as he often does. ""Isn&apost it ironic? Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on trade. We have the worst trade deals ever made. Then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea and the nuclear problem. But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the witch hunt!"" I think he&aposs going to have to trademark that. There are capital A and capital D on ""Angry Democrats."" We are going to talk about that angle after this.

          Chrissy Teigen leaves a generous tip, but the waitress said she didn't keep it all.
           (Reuters) To mark the occasion of President Trumpâ€™s birthday, Chrissy Teigen took to Twitter on Thursday to bash his immigration policy and to make a donation in his honor. Teigen, who is an outspoken opponent of Trump and his administration,  posted a note to Twitter  explaining that she and each member of her family are donating $72,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to mark the occasion of Trumpâ€™s 72nd birthday. â€œThe President celebrates his 72nd birthday today. On this auspicious occasion, in order to Make Trumpâ€™s Birthday Great Again, each member of our family has donated $72,000 to the ACLU,â€ the model wrote, encouraging her followers to donate what they can to the organization in honor of Trumpâ€™s birthday. â€œThe ACLU is committed to defending the rights of humanity and these vulnerable families,â€ Teigen said in her statement. â€œIn addition to fighting for immigrantsâ€™ rights, theyâ€™re advocating for reproductive rights, voting rights, criminal justice reform, LGBT rights, 1st amendment rights and holding the Trump administration accountable whenever possible.â€ The star opened her remarks by noting that, although the gesture to donate was done in honor of the president&aposs birthday, her feelings about the administrationâ€™s immigration policies are what drove her and her husband, John Legend, to encourage support in the ACLU at this time. â€œJohn and I are outraged to see and hear the horror stories of immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration. These actions are cruel, anti-family and go against everything we believe this country should represent.â€ Teigen has had the presidentâ€™s birthday in her crosshairs for a while. Last week, she  tweeted a link to Trumpâ€™s digital birthday card  encouraging her followers to sign it with whatever they wanted. â€œJust know this is his official birthday card so make sure itâ€™s from the heart!â€ she said. â€œHappy Birthday, champ.â€ Since then, the post has been flooded with Teigenâ€™s fans sharing their negative comments that they shared on Trumpâ€™s digital card.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chrissy-teigen-slams-trump-on-his-birthday-encourages-fans-to-donate-to-aclu-to-mark-the-occasion,Political,Fox News,

It didnâ€™t take President Trump long after his return from Singapore to resume his bashing of the Russia investigation, Thursday calling the underlying allegations a â€œpile of garbage,â€ and blasting Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Democrats for pushing the â€œphony crimeâ€ of collusion. The president returned Wednesday from his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Trump returned to his usual public criticism of the Russia investigation by mid-day Thursday. â€œNow that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime,â€ Trump tweeted. Minutes later, he went further to set up a perceived scenario. â€œSo, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Counsel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!â€ Trump tweeted. The president was referring to former FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s decision to share notes memorializing conversations with Trump with his friend, Columbia University Law Professor Daniel Richman. Comey testified last year that he shared the memo with Richman to leak to The New York Times in an effort to spur the appointment of a special counsel to investigate any Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election. Last year, Richman told Fox News that of the seven memos Comey wrote, he was given four. This year, The Wall Street Journal reported that at least two of the memos Comey shared have been found to contain material now deemed classified. Richman is now serving as Comeyâ€™s attorney. The presidentâ€™s tweets came just hours before the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz was slated to release his highly-anticipated report expected to reveal whether ""certain underlying investigative decisionsâ€ in the FBIâ€™s investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s private email server â€œwere based on improper considerations.â€ Both Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, have been fired from the bureau.

Speaking at a meeting Thursday in the Kremlin with the North Korean parliament speaker, Putin said ""we welcome and highly assess"" the summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Putin noted that the standoff over North Korea ""worried the entire world and could entail grave consequences, including a major military conflict."" He added that the meeting helped ""push back that unfavorable scenario and raised prospects for solving all the problems with peaceful and diplomatic means."" The head of the Supreme People&aposs Assembly, Kim Yong Nam, handed Putin a letter from the North Korean leader. Putin reaffirmed his invitation to Kim to visit Russia. ___ 2:30 p.m. South Korean President Moon Jae-in says South Koreans strongly support the outcome of the summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and that bad reviews of the meeting were from people ""isolated"" from public thinking. South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom described Moon&aposs comments from a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday. Pompeo said in Seoul that Trump&aposs tweet about North Korea no longer posing a nuclear threat was made ""with eyes wide open."" Moon and Pompeo also agreed that Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang could collaborate on recovering the remains of soldiers missing and presumed dead from the 1950-53 Korean War. ___ 12:15 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says there will be no sanctions relief for North Korea until it denuclearizes. Pompeo is pushing back on a report from North Korean official state media that said President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un had agreed to a ""step-by-step"" process. That was interpreted as meaning the U.S. would grant concessions to North Korea concessions along the way despite longstanding U.S. insistence that it would not. Pompeo says Trump has been ""incredibly clear"" about the sequencing of the process. Speaking alongside Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers in Seoul, Pompeo says that ""we&aposre going to get denuclearization."" He says that ""only then will there be relief from the sanctions."" ___ 12:10 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says President Donald Trump&aposs comment about North Korea no longer posing a nuclear threat was made ""with eyes wide open.""

Pompeo says Trump was referring to the fact that for the first time in history, a U.S. president sat down with a North Korean leader. He says Trump and Kim Jong Un had a ""blunt conversation"" about changes needed for North Korea to rejoin the world community. Pompeo also says that Trump was ""unequivocal"" with Kim about the need for North Korea to return abductees from Japan seized by the North in the 1970s and 1980s. ___ 10 a.m. The top diplomats from the United States, Japan and South Korea are discussing the North Korean nuclear threat and U.S. diplomacy with Kim Jong Un. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in Seoul. The three posed for photos before sitting with their delegations at three tables arranged in a U-shaped formation. They ignored a shouted question from an American journalist about President Donald Trump&aposs decision to halt joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. The three-way meeting comes as U.S. allies and South Korea seek more details about Trump&aposs unprecedented nuclear summit with Kim in Singapore on Tuesday and what&aposs next for U.S. nuclear negotiations with the North. ___ 9:40 a.m. The rival Koreas are holding rare high-level military talks to discuss reducing tensions across their heavily fortified border following North Korean leader Kim Jong Un&aposs summit with President Donald Trump. It&aposs possible North Korean officials during Thursday&aposs talks will seek a firm commitment from the South on stopping military drills with the United States. Trump said after his summit with Kim on Tuesday that the joint military exercises should stop. South Korea has said it&aposs trying to discern Trump&aposs meaning and intent. Seoul&aposs Defense Ministry says the military talks will focus on carrying out agreements from a summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in which they vowed to take steps to reduce military tensions and eliminate the danger of war.

Trump-bashing FBI agent Peter Strzok and former bureau lawyer Lisa Page used their work phones to conceal their extramarital affair from their spouses, according to the Â bombshell report  released Thursday by the Department of Justice inspector general. â€œThe predominant reason that we communicated on our work phones was because we were trying to keep our affair a secret from our spouses,"" Page told the IG. Page, who worked as counsel to the FBI, admitted to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz that she and Strzok used the Clinton email probe as cover for their communications.

TREY GOWDY RIPS STRZOK: &aposTHIS IS NOT THE FBI I KNOW&apos In August 2016, the IG notes, Strzok vowed to Page that they could ""stop"" Trump from becoming president, although the IG did not find that political bias tainted specific investigative decisions in the Clinton probe. Trump is ""not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ Page texted to Strzok. â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it,â€ Strzok responded. The lovers exchanged numerous other anti-Trump texts during the investigation in the lead-up to the presidential election, including one in which Page calls Trump a ""loathsome human"" and another in which Strzok dubs him an ""idiot."" But Page insisted she had kept her personal views separate from the investigation. â€œI guess I didnâ€™t feel like I was doing anything wrong,"" Page said. ""Iâ€™m an American. We have the First Amendment. Iâ€™m entitled to an opinion. ... I saw it as, I still see it as so separate from the investigative activity we were taking in the, in Midyear [Clinton probe] that I didnâ€™t, didnâ€™t really think about it, to be honest with you.â€ IG REPORT UNCOVERS ADDITIONAL FBI AGENTS WHO DISCUSSED THEIR HATRED FOR TRUMP In the report, Horowitz says that law enforcement agencies like the FBI can impose sanctions for unprofessionalism by employees who engage in certain political activities that compromise the appearance of integrity in an investigation. ""While these employees did not give up their First Amendment rights when they became employed by the FBI, Supreme Court decisions make clear that the FBI retains the authority â€” particularly as a law enforcement agency â€” to impose certain restrictions on its employeesâ€™ speech in the interest of providing effective  and efficient government,"" Horowitz writes.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbis-anti-trump-lovebirds-page-and-strzok-used-work-phones-to-shield-affair-from-spouses-ig-report,POLITICS,Fox News,
14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Associated Press,"After summit, North Korea shows Trump in new light","PYONGYANG, North Korea â€“  North Koreans are getting a new look at U.S. President Donald Trump now that his summit with leader Kim Jong Un is over and it&aposs a far cry from the ""dotard"" label their government slapped on him last year. Previously, even on a good day, the best he might get was ""Trump."" No honorifics. No signs of respect. Now, he&aposs being called ""the president of the United States of America."" Or ""President Donald J. Trump."" Even ""supreme leader."" The post-summit transformation of North Korea&aposs official version of Trump, who&aposs now being shown by the state media looking serious and almost regal, underscores the carefully choreographed reality show the government has had to perform to keep its people, taught from childhood to hate and distrust the ""American imperialists,"" ideologically on board with the tectonic shifts underway in their country&aposs relationship with Washington. With a time lag that suggests a great deal of care and thought went into the final product, the North&aposs state-run television aired its first videos and photos of the summit on Thursday, two days after the event and a full day after Kim returned home to Pyongyang, the capital. To be sure, the star of the show was Kim. Trump&aposs first appearance and the now famous handshake didn&apost come until almost 20 minutes into the 42-minute program. To the dramatic, almost song-like intonations of the nation&aposs most famous newscaster, the program depicted Kim as statesmanlike beyond his years, confident and polite, quick to smile and firmly in control. He was shown allowing the older American â€” Trump, in his seventies, is more than twice Kim&aposs age â€” to lean in toward him to shake hands, or give a thumbs up, then walking a few steps ahead to a working lunch. Before showing the two signing their joint statement, the newscaster said Trump made a point of giving Kim a look at his armored Cadillac limousine, and noted that it is known to Americans as ""the Beast."" She also at one point called them the ""two supreme leaders"" of their countries. The image-heavy news of Kim&aposs trip to Singapore was presented like a chronological documentary, starting with the red-carpet send off at the Pyongyang airport on, interestingly enough, a chartered Air China flight. That was followed by video of his motorcade making its way to the St. Regis Hotel in Singapore as throngs of well-wishers waved as though awaiting a rock star, and Kim&aposs night tour of the city-state on the summit&aposs eve. The state media&aposs representation of the summit and Trump is extremely important because it gives the North Korean population, which has only limited access to other news sources, an idea not just of what&aposs going on but also of how the government expects them to respond. For the average North Korean, the state media&aposs coverage of Kim&aposs diplomatic blitz this year must seem nothing short of astonishing. After sending a top-level delegation that included his own sister to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, Kim has met twice each with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Chinese President Xi Jinping and the state media have splashed all of the meetings across its front pages and newscasts â€” though generally a day after the fact to allow time to make sure the ideological tone is right and the images as powerful as possible. In the run-up to the summit, the North&aposs media softened its rhetoric so as not to spoil the atmosphere as Kim prepared to sit down with the leader of the country North Korea has maligned and lambasted for decades as the most evil place on Earth, other than perhaps Japan, its former colonial ruler. It fired a few barrages against hard-line comments by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton and has stood ever critical of ""capitalist values,"" but has kept direct references to Trump to a minimum. Bolton, who has been a target of Pyongyang&aposs ire since his service in the George W. Bush administration, was introduced in the Thursday program dead-pan and shown shaking Kim&aposs hand. What this all means for the future is a complicated matter. North Korea has presented Kim&aposs diplomatic strategy as a logical next step following what he has said is the completion of his plan to develop a credible nuclear deterrent to what Pyongyang has long claimed is a policy of hostility and ""nuclear blackmail"" by Washington. That was its message through the news on Thursday, which stressed that the talks with Trump would be focused on forging a relationship that is more in tune with what it called changing times â€” most likely meaning North Korea&aposs new status as a nuclear weapons state â€” and its desire for a mechanism to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and, finally, denuclearization. Despite the respectful tone, there remains a clear undercurrent of caution. Kim remains the hero in the official Pyongyang narrative. Whether Trump will be his co-star, or once again the villain, is fodder for another episode. ___ Talmadge is the AP&aposs Pyongyang bureau chief.

14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Brooke Singman,New York AG files lawsuit against Trump Foundation for alleged 'illegal conduct;' Trump says he 'won't settle',"close Video New York attorney general sues Trump Foundation Lawsuit is looking at violations of state and federal law. The New York state attorney generalâ€™s office on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation for alleged illegal conduct and â€œunlawful political coordinationâ€ to benefit personal and business interests, drawing a harsh Twitter rebuke from President Trump. The suit was brought Thursday, following a months-long investigation led by â€œdisgracedâ€ - in Trump&aposs words - former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed the lawsuit Thursday over the foundationâ€™s alleged â€œpersistent illegal conductâ€ which occurred over â€œmore than a decade.â€ The suit alleges that there was â€œextensive unlawful political coordinationâ€ with Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign, and alleged violations of â€œbasic legal obligations for non-profit foundations.â€ But the president fired back on Twitter Thursday, blasting the lawsuit, and Schneiderman for â€œneverâ€ having â€œthe gutsâ€ to bring the suit while he held the post. â€œThe sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. I wonâ€™t settle this case!â€ Trump tweeted. â€œSchneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle,â€ Trump added, moments later. 
      New York's Acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation Thursday.
       (AP) The suit claims that Trump used the foundationâ€™s charitable assets to pay off his legal obligations, promote Trump brand hotels and businesses, and to purchase personal items. The suit also claims that the foundation â€œillegally provided extensive support to his 2016 presidential campaign by using the Trump Foundationâ€™s name and funds it raised from the public to promote his campaign for presidency.â€ â€œAs our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,â€ Underwood said in a statement Thursday. â€œThis is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the Foundation and its directors accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.â€ Underwood initiated a proceeding to dissolve the foundation under court supervision, and obtain restitution of $2.8 million, and additional penalties, according to the attorney generalâ€™s office. The suit also seeks to ban President Trump from future service as a director of a New York non-profit for 10 years, and ban Eric, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka from service for one year. A spokesperson for the Trump Foundation, in a statement to Fox News, called the lawsuit â€œpolitics at its very worst,â€ noting that the foundation has donated over $19 million to charitable causes â€œmore than it ever received.â€ The spokesperson also said Trump contributed himself, or through his companies, more than $8 million, noting that the organization â€œwas able to donate more than it took inâ€ because â€œit had little to no expenses.â€ The spokesperson also said that the foundation â€œcurrently has $1.7 million remaining, which the NYAG has been holding hostage for political gain.â€ â€œThis is unconscionable â€“ particularly because the Foundation previously announced its intention to dissolve more than a year and a half ago,â€ a spokesperson for the foundation said in a statement to Fox News. â€œThe prior NYAG, who was recently forced to resign from office in disgrace, made it his stated mission to use this matter to not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fundraising.â€ The spokesperson added: â€œThe acting NYAGâ€™s recent statement that battling the White House is â€˜the most important work [she] have ever doneâ€™ shows that such political attacks will continue unabated.â€ Underwood took over the investigation into the organization in May, after Schneiderman stepped down following the publication of a damning report by The New Yorker, detailing four womenâ€™s claims that he had repeatedly hit them, threatened them and demeaned them. The graphic accusations included choking a former girlfriend and demanding another, who was born in Sri Lanka and whom Schneiderman reportedly referred to as his â€œbrown slave,â€ call him â€œMaster.â€ The Manhattan District Attorney opened an investigation into Schneiderman following the explosive report that prompted his stunning fall from grace. Underwoodâ€™s lawsuit Thursday also alleged that none of the foundationâ€™s expenditures were approved by the Board of Directors, and stated that Trump â€œalone made all decisions related to the Foundation.â€ The attorney generalâ€™s office released an email dated Jan. 29, 2016 from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, which requested that the foundation â€œmake some disbursements this week while in Iowa.â€ The attorney generalâ€™s office said that, following that email, at least five $100,000 grants were made to groups in Iowa in the days before the February 1, 2016 Iowa caucuses. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to Fox Newsâ€™ request for comment. Underwoodâ€™s office also sent referral letters Thursday to the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service, suggesting â€œadditional investigation and potential further legal actionâ€ by the agencies â€œare warranted.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-he-wont-settle,Controversies,Fox News,

           (AP) Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Clay Buchholz may keep his support for President Trump quiet, but he has a lot to thank him for. Buchholz, 33, revealed Wednesday that he credits Trump for giving him the opportunity to meet the woman he would eventually marry and have three children with. Buchholz told  USA Today  that when he was with the Boston Red Sox in 2008 he and about a dozen teammates when to a UFC fight in Southern California -- then went to an afterparty as Trumpâ€™s guests. â€œI remember him saying, â€˜OK, whoâ€™s single here and whoâ€™s married?â€™ Buchholz told the newspaper. â€œI told him I was single. Thatâ€™s when he introduced me.â€ The woman he met was Lindsay Clubine, who was a model on the show â€œDeal or No Dealâ€ at the time. She was helping the business mogulâ€™s â€œAffliction: Banned Fightâ€ event, according to USA Today. The two were married a year later. â€œIf not for the president, none of this [is] possible,â€ Buchholz said. â€œHeâ€™ll always be a good friend. Iâ€™m able to tell my kids that the president of the United States introduced their mom and dad.â€ â€œIf not for the president, none of this [is] possible. Heâ€™ll always be a good friend.

However, Buchholz said he hasnâ€™t talked to Trump since the 2016 election. The Texas native has had a solid career despite injuries that have plagued him. In his first season in Arizona, Buchholz is 1-1 with a 3.21 ERA and 23 strikeouts in five starts.",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/arizona-diamondbacks-pitcher-credits-trump-with-helping-him-meet-his-wife,MLB,Fox News,

But it will mark the most definitive accounting of the email probe to date, looking at -- among other things -- whether â€œcertain underlying investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.â€Â Among the top Justice Department and FBI officials expected to face scrutiny in Horowitzâ€™s report: fired FBI Director James Comey, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and FBI official Peter Strzok. David Bossie: Much-anticipated Inspector General's  report on DOJ, FBI comes out -- then what ? NO MORE &aposWAR GAMES&apos? -  The Pentagon is expected to cancel the next major joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea scheduled for August , a senior administration official told Fox News late Wednesday, the same week President Trump said he would move to stop U.S. war games at the Korean Peninsula ... Â The official said the Pentagon likely would make the formal cancelation announcement in a press release Thursday. Trump discussed U.S. actions in the region in a news conference Tuesday following his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  AnÂ agreement signed by Trump and Kim at the summit  does not have any mention of suspending war games. Pentagon officials were surprised when the president referred to the war games as ""provocative,"" as the U.S. military had always characterized them as ""defensive"" in nature.Â The upcoming joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise is called Ulchi Freedom Guardian.

Â In a letter sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and signed by all 13 GOP members, the committee wrote that the DOJ limiting the briefing to the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" was ""unacceptable and an affront to the oversight powers of the House of Representatives.""Â Speaking to Fox News&apos ""Hannity"" Wednesday night, committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said ""people in America should be alarmed"" at the Justice Department&aposs actions ""to hide information."" The ""Gang of Eight"" refers to Republican and Democratic leaders in both houses of Congress as well as top lawmakers from the House and Senate intelligence panels.Â  Last week, Nunes set a June 12 deadline for the Justice Department to hand over documents related to the alleged informant  to all committee members ""and designated staff.""

14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Alex Pappas,"IG report on Clinton email probe reveals FBI agent's 'stop'-Trump text, calls Comey 'insubordinate'","close Video IG Report: Comey broke protocol Comey's decisions had a fateful impact on the 2016 campaign; Catherine Herridge reports from the Justice Department. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, in a comprehensive and at-times scathing report on the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, exposed extraordinaryÂ text messages by a top FBI official vowing to ""stop"" Donald Trump -- while calling then-director James Comey&aposs actions in the case ""insubordinate."" The long-awaited report was released Thursday afternoon, spanning nearly 600 pages and scrutinizing the actions of numerous figures who played a key role in the Justice Department and FBI&aposs investigation. It is the product of an 18-month review, incorporating dozens of witness interviews and hundreds of thousands of documents. But one of the most stunning findings concerns texts between agent Peter Strzok and bureau colleague Lisa Page. According to the report, Page texted Strzok in August 2016 and said: â€œ[Trumpâ€™s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it,â€ Strzok responded. Strzok was a lead investigator on the Clinton case and later worked the Russia investigation before being removed from that assignment. Video â€œIn particular, we were concerned about text messages exchanged by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Special Counsel to the Deputy Director, that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,â€ the IG report said. Still, the report said investigators found â€œno evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations.â€ Months ago, Horowitz revealed other anti-Trump texts between the two FBI officials, who were romantically involved. The ""stop"" Trump text goes further, and fueled claims from the White House that the bureau was biased against him. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the report ""reaffirmed the president&aposs suspicions about Comey&aposs conduct and the political bias amongst some of the members of the FBI."" Video The FBI, in its response to the review, said the inspector general â€œfound no evidence to connect the political views expressed by these employees with the specific investigative decisions.â€ But it said the inspector general has referred five employees for investigation into whether the messages violated the FBIâ€™s Offense Codes and Penalty Guidelines. Three takeaways from IG report After an 18-month investigation into the FBI and DOJâ€™s Hillary Clinton probe, the highly anticipated report from the Justice Departmentâ€™s Inspector General Michael Horowitz is out. Hereâ€™s a look at the three biggest takeaways. Horowitzâ€™s investigation looked at a variety of other allegations, including whether it was improper for Comey to make a public announcement recommending against prosecution over the Clinton email arrangement while calling her actions ""extremely careless."" ""We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions from his superiors, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, for the admitted purpose of preventing them from telling him not to make the statement, and to instruct his subordinates in the FBI to do the same,"" Horowitzâ€™s report says. CLICK TO READ THE FULL REPORT Comey responded to the report on Thursday by tweeting that he believes the â€œconclusions are reasonable, even though I disagree with some.â€ â€œPeople of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently,â€ Comey said. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, citing the Clinton email probe -- though he later cited the Russia probe as well. The report also faults the FBI â€“ and specifically StrzokÂ â€“ for not acting quickly enough after the discovery of Clinton emails on the laptop of ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner in the fall of 2016. The report says Strzok and others argued that the Russia investigation was a â€œhigher priorityâ€ at the time than reviewing the laptop. â€œWe found this explanation unpersuasive and concerning,â€ the report said, noting the FBI could have gotten a search warrant in late September, but waited more than a month to do so -- ultimately revisiting the case days before the election. Clinton has long said that announcement contributed to her defeat. But the report also suggested that Strzok, ironically, may have acted out of bias for Clinton in slow-walking the laptop review. Video Based on the Strzok text messages, the report said, â€œWe concluded that we did not have confidence that this decision by Strzok was free from bias.â€ In the report, Horowitz also criticized then-Attorney General Loretta Lynchâ€™s infamous meeting on an Arizona tarmac with former President Bill Clinton just days before the FBI decided it would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. The report said investigators ""found no evidence"" of an ""inappropriate discussion."" But it found that Lynchâ€™s ""failure to recognize the appearance problem created by former President Clintonâ€™s visit and to take action to cut the visit short was an error in judgment."" House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said in a statement the report shows â€œan alarming and destructive level of animus displayed by top officials at the FBI.â€ Other Republican lawmakers pounced on the newly revealed Strzok text. â€œIn Louisiana, we call that bias, we don&apost call that objective,â€ Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on Fox Newsâ€™ â€œOutnumbered Overtimeâ€ on Thursday. Strzok had been assigned to Robert Muellerâ€™s special counsel probe, but has since been reassigned. Page later resigned. Video An attorney for Strzok, Aitan Goelman, denied the agentâ€™s personal political views influenced his work. â€œHis dedication to unbiased service is a fact that would be universally echoed by the thousands of people who have worked with Pete during his 26 years of service in the FBI and U.S. Army,â€ Goelman said. The final report could lead to repercussions for some in the DOJ and FBI. Video Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the report â€œreveals a number of significant errors by the senior leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI during the previous administration.â€ In an interview with The Hillâ€™s new web show â€œRisingâ€ on Wednesday, Sessions said the option of â€œterminationâ€ is on the table for those accused of serious wrongdoing. Some of the key figures, though, have already been fired or left the government. A related review already has put former top FBI official Andrew McCabe in legal jeopardy. The Justice Departmentâ€™s internal watchdog sent a criminal referral for McCabe in April to the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Washington. That was in response to Horowitzâ€™s finding that McCabe leaked information to the press and later lied about it to Comey and federal investigators, prompting Sessions to fire him in March. The Washington Post reported that Comey has since been questioned by the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office as part of a McCabe investigation. In his report Thursday, Horowitz also reviewed the circumstances of whether McCabe should have recused himself earlier from the Clinton probe because of his familyâ€™s ties to the Democratic Party. McCabeâ€™s wife took campaign money from a group tied to then-Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally, during her unsuccessful run for office in Virginia in 2015. McCabe did not recuse himself until a week before the 2016 election. Horowitz said McCabe â€œdid not fully comply with his recusal in a few instancesâ€ related to the Clinton Foundation investigation. He also said the FBIâ€™s ethics officials and attorneys â€œdid not fully appreciate the potential significant implicationsâ€ to McCabe and the FBI from campaign contributions to his wifeâ€™s campaign. An attorney for McCabe, Michael Bromwich, said in a Thursday statement that â€œany and all claims that political bias or political influence affected Mr. McCabeâ€™s actionsâ€ are â€œentirely baseless.â€ In a  New York Times op-ed  on Thursday, Comey stood by his decision not to recommend prosecuting Clinton over her emails while secretary of state. â€œThe report also resoundingly demonstrates that there was no prosecutable case against Mrs. Clinton, as we had concluded,â€ Comey said. â€œAlthough that probably will not stop some from continuing to claim the opposite is true, this independent assessment will be useful to thoughtful people and an important contribution to the historical record.â€ Fox Newsâ€™ Catherine Herridge, Judson Berger, Bill Mears, Jake Gibson and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ig-report-on-clinton-email-probe-reveals-fbi-agents-stop-trump-text-calls-comey-insubordinate,POLITICS,Fox News,

Hereâ€™s a look at the three biggest takeaways. An unidentified FBI employee described Trump voters as ""uneducated"" and ""lazy POS"" the day after the 2016 presidential election, according to the Justice Department watchdog&aposs bombshell report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The employee was responding to instant messages from ""FBI Attorney 2,"" whom DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz indicated was one of five FBI employees who had been referred for investigation and possible disciplinary action over politically charged messages. Horowitz said Attorney 2 had been assigned to the Clinton investigation ""early in 2016."" Approximately one year later, the report said Attorney 2 was made the ""primary FBI attorney"" assigned to the Russia investigation. IG REFERS FIVE FBI EMPLOYEES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS MORE ANTI-TRUMP MESSAGES REVEALED On the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, Attorney 2 messaged the employee: ""I am so stressed about what I could have done differently."" The employee answered: ""Don&apost stress. None of that mattered,"" an apparent reference to the FBI&aposs investigation of Clinton. When the attorney said: ""I donâ€™t know. We broke the momentum,"" the employee answered: ""That is not so."" ""All the people who were initially voting for her would not, and were not, swayed by any decision the FBI put out,"" the employee wrote. ""Trumpâ€™s supporters are all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS that think he will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. They probably didn&apost watch the debates, aren&apost fully educated on his policies, and are stupidly wrapped up in his unmerited enthusiasm."" ""POS"" is an acronym that typically means ""piece[s] of s---."" Video ""Attorney 2"" later messaged the employee: ""I&aposm just devastated. I can&apost wait until I can leave today and just shut off the world for the next four days."" He later added: ""I just can&apost imagine the systematic disassembly of the progress we made over the last 8 years. [The Affordable Care Act] is gone. Who knows if the rhetoric about deporting people, walls, and crap is true. I honestly feel like there is going to be a lot more gun issues, too, the crazies won finally. This is the tea party on steroids. And the GOP is going to be lost, they have to deal with an incumbent in 4 years. We have to fight this again. Also [Vice President Mike] Pence is stupid."" When asked about the messages, ""Attorney 2"" said the two were ""just discussing our personal feelings ... between friends."" He also told the watchdog that the ""so stressed about what I could have done differently"" message referred to the length of time investigators took to examine Clinton emails found on former Congressman Anthony Weiner&aposs laptop. Video ""[I]f we would have opened a few weeks earlier, as opposed to at that time, two weeks before the election, I think it, you know, it would have given more time for the FBIâ€™s actions and, and required and, and necessary investigation to, to occur to allow the, the public a chance to make their own [decisions]."" The Nov. 9 exchange of messages was one of three that Horowitz flagged as raising ""concerns of potential bias"" on the part of ""Attorney 2."" Another exchange took place on Oct. 28, 2016, the day then-FBI Director James Comey notified Congress that he was reopening the Clinton email investigation after emails were found on Weiner&aposs laptop. According to Horowitz, the attorney send messages to four separate FBI employees that referred to Comey&aposs letter as ""the destruction of the Republic."" ""I mean, I never really liked the Republic anyway,"" the attorney messaged two different FBI employees, while a message to a third read: ""As I have initiated the destruction of the republic....

When questioned by the inspector general&aposs office, Attorney 2 described the language in the Oct. 28 messages as ""hyperbolic"" and ""off-the cuff commentary to friends.""

           (Associated Press) President Donald Trumpâ€™s remarks about North Korea no longer being a nuclear threat were made â€œwith eyes wide open,â€ U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday. In remarks at a news conference in Seoul, the top U.S. diplomat added that any sanctions relief North Korea receives from the U.S. will be linked to efforts to denuclearize. Pompeo added that Trump was â€œincredibly clearâ€ to Kim about when the U.S. would lift the sanctions. â€œWeâ€™re going to get denuclearization,â€ he stressed at the joint news conferenceÂ with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, following their trilateral meeting in South Korea&aposs capital. â€œOnly then will there be relief from the sanctions,â€ he added. â€œWeâ€™re going to get denuclearization.

Video The presidentâ€™s remarks about North Korea no longer being a threat were echoed Thursday by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who said the Trump-Kim summit meant the world had escaped the threat of war. â€œThere have been many analyses on the outcome of the summit,""Â Moon told Pompeo ahead of their meeting,Â  Reuters Â reported. ""But I think whatâ€™s most important was that the people of the world, including those in the United States, Japan and Koreans, have all been able to escape the threat of war, nuclear weapons and missiles.â€ The president was also â€œunequivocalâ€ with Kim about the need to return abductees from Japan seized by the North in the 1970s and 1980s, Pompeo said at the news conference. Pompeo also pushed back against reports coming from North Korean official state media, claiming Trump and Kim agreed to a â€œstep-by-stepâ€ process, with many interpreting the announcement as the U.S. giving concessions to the regime along the way.

14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Brooke Singman,"IG refers five FBI employees for investigation, as more anti-Trump messages revealed","close Video Strzok, Page wanted to undermine then-candidate Trump: Chris Farrell Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell discusses the texts exchanged between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The Justice Department inspector general has referred five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, revealing in its report on the Hillary Clinton email case that more bureau officials than previously thought were exchanging anti-Trump messages. The long-awaited report largely dealt with the Justice Department and FBI&aposs handling of the Clinton case but uncovered numerous messages that â€œappeared to mix political opinion with discussions about the MYE investigation."" MYE, or ""Midyear Exam,"" was the code used in the FBI to refer to the investigation into Clintonâ€™s private email server. â€œSome of these text messages and instant messages mixed political commentary with discussions about the Midyear investigation, and raised concerns that political bias may have impacted investigative decisions,â€ the report read. The report noted that it was specifically concerned about text messages exchanged between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page that â€œpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.â€ Strzok and Page, who were romantically involved, both served for a short period of time on Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s Russia investigation team. Strzok was reassigned following the revelations of his anti-Trump texts. Page resigned last month. But while many of those texts were made public in late 2017, the IG report revealed a new one in which Strzok vowed to ""stop"" Trump from becoming president -- and made clear that as many as five total FBI employees exchanged politically charged messages. ""The text messages and instant messages sent by these employees included statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton,"" the report said. The report revealed instant messages between unnamed agents, labeled â€œAgent 1â€ and â€œAgent 5,â€ discussing their jobs in August 2016. â€œI find anyone who enjoys [this job] an absolute f---ing idiot. If you donâ€™t think so, ask them one more question. Who are you voting for? I guarantee you it will be Donald Drumpf,â€ Agent 1 sent. â€œI forgot about drumpfâ€¦thatâ€™s so sad and pathetic if they want to vote for him,â€ Agent 5 responded. â€œSomeone who canâ€™t answer a question. Someone who canâ€™t be professional for even a second.â€ In September, Agent 1 and 5 conversed again, bashing Trump supporters as â€œretarded.â€ â€œIâ€™m trying to think of a â€˜would I ratherâ€™ instead of spending time with those people,â€ Agent 5 sent. Agent 1 asked, â€œstick your tongue in a fan??â€ Agent 5 later wrote: â€œI would rather have brunch with trump and a bunch of his supporters like the ones from ohio that are retarded.â€ The report did not, however, find evidence connecting those political opinions held by FBI officials to decisions made in the Clinton investigation. â€œThere were clearly tensions and disagreements in a number of important areas between Midyear agents and prosecutors. However, we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisionsâ€¦,â€ the report read. â€œNonetheless, these messages cast a cloud over the FBIâ€™s handling of the Midyear investigation and the investigationâ€™s credibility.â€ Futher, the report said that while it found no evidence the views influenced investigative decisions, â€œfive employeesâ€ have been referred for investigation into whether the messages violated FBI code. â€œThe FBI will handle these referrals pursuant to the FBIâ€™s disciplinary investigation and adjudication processes, and will impose disciplinary measures as warranted,â€ the report read. It is unclear which five FBI employees have been referred for investigation. An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Thursday they were not able to comment on the names of the five employees referred for investigation. The IG report included a new text conversation between Strzok and Page from August 2016. â€œ[Trumpâ€™s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ Page texted Strzok. â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it,â€Â  Strzok responded. Those texts â€œcaused [the OIG] to question the earlier Midyear investigative decisions in which he was involved, and whether he took specific actions in the Midyear investigation based on his political views,â€ the report read. In a statement to Fox News, Strzokâ€™s attorney Aitan Goelman defended Strzokâ€™s work at the FBI. â€œAfter a year-long investigation that included a review of millions of communications and interviews of scores of witnesses, the IG concluded that there is no evidence that the political views of Special Agent Strzok and others in the FBI impacted the handling of the Clinton email investigation,â€ Goelman said in a statement. â€œAs the Report notes, Special Agent Strzok in particular was consistently thorough and aggressive, sometimes to the point that put him at odds with senior officials at the Department of Justice.â€ Goelman added: â€œWhile pundits and politicians are using this matter to advance their agendas, the truth about Special Agent Strzokâ€™s character and professionalism is found in the fact thatÂ  every Â witness asked by the OIG said that Strzokâ€™s work wasÂ  never Â influenced by political views. His dedication to unbiased service is a fact that would be universally echoed by the thousands of people who have worked with Pete during his 26 years of service in the FBI and U.S. Army.â€ The report also reveals that one FBI attorney assigned to the special counsel&aposs team was found to have sent politically charged FBINet instant messages to other FBI officials. That FBI employee sent messages such as: ""As I have initiated the destruction of the republic...Would you be so kind as to have a coffee with me this afternoon?"" Another instant message read: ""I&aposm clinging to small pockets of happiness in the dark time of the Republic&aposs destruction."" The report did not reveal this FBI official&aposs name, but did state that the official worked on both the Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe. The FBI official left the special counsel&aposs team in February of this year, following revelations of his politically charged messages.

14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Frank Miles,North Korea's state media depict Kim as hero and star of the Singapore summit with Trump,"
          North Koreaâ€™s state media aired a 42-minute video, its take on the historic Trump-Kim summit. Kim Jong Un was its hero and star.
           With a time lag that suggests a great deal of care and thought went into the final product, North Koreaâ€™s state media aired a 42-minute-long video offering its perspective on the historic meeting of President Trump and Kim Jong Un. In that narrative, Kim is the unambiguous hero. The state-run television aired these first videos and photos of the summit on Thursday, two days after the event and a full day after Kim returned home to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. â€œA lot of leaders of different countries have visited Singapore, but it is unprecedented in the history of Singapore to have streets filled with the welcoming crowd like this,â€ said Ri Chun-hee, the newsreader on state media, according toÂ  CNN . â€œStreets were full of people admiring the supreme leader for his brilliant political skills to lead complex and eventful international politics.â€ The state mediaâ€™s representation of the summit and Trump is extremely important because it gives North Koreans an idea not just of whatâ€™s going on, but of what response the government expects. CNN reported that the video was likely some North Koreansâ€™ first glimpse of the world outside the borders of their restricted and reclusive country. And Kim was the star of the show. 
      The video was likely some North Koreansâ€™ first glimpse of the world outside the borders of their restricted and reclusive country, showing Kim in Singapore for the summit.
       Trumpâ€™s first appearance and the now-famous handshake didnâ€™t come until almost 20 minutes into the program. To the dramatic, almost musical intonations of the nationâ€™s most famous newscaster, the program depicted Kim as statesmanlike beyond his years, confident and polite, quick to smile and firmly in control. He was shown allowing the older American â€” Trump, in his 70s, is more than twice Kimâ€™s age â€” to lean in toward him to shake hands, or give a thumbs up. The program also showed an awkward moment in which Trump reached out to shake the hand of a North Korean general,Â  who instead saluted the American president. Trump saluted the officer in return, and the two then shook hands. Before showing Trump and Kim signing their joint statement, the newscaster said Trump made a point of giving Kim a look at his armored Cadillac limousine, and noted that it is known to Americans as â€œthe Beast.â€ The image-heavy news of Kimâ€™s trip to Singapore was presented like a chronologically organized documentary, starting with the red-carpet sendoff for Kim at the Pyongyang airport on, interestingly enough, a chartered Air China flight. That was followed by video of his motorcade making its way to the St. Regis hotel in Singapore as throngs of well-wishers assembled as though awaiting a rock star, and footage of Kim&aposs city-state night tour on Summit Eve. The post-summit transformation of North Koreaâ€™s official version of Trump, whoâ€™s now being shown by state media looking serious and almost regal, underscores the carefully choreographed reality show the government has had to orchestrate. The goal:Â  to keep its people, taught from childhood to hate and distrust the â€œAmerican imperialists,â€ ideologically on board with seismic shifts in the relationship with Washington The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-koreas-state-media-depict-kim-as-hero-and-star-of-the-singapore-summit-with-trump,North Korea,Fox News,
14/06/2018 00:00,2018,6,14,Alex Pappas,FBI agent Strzok reportedly texted 'we'll stop' Trump from becoming president,"close Video Strzok's role in Clinton, Russia probes in focus Republican lawmakers press FBI espionage chief Bill Priestap on his former number two's role in the Clinton email and Russia investigations; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports. FBI agent Peter Strzok texted a fellow bureau official in August 2016 that â€œweâ€™ll stopâ€ Donald Trump from becoming president, the Justice Department inspector general reportedly reveals in his highly anticipated report on the Hillary Clinton email case. The Washington Post  reported that Inspector General Michael Horowitzâ€™s report includes an August 2016 text message exchange between Strzok and then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page about Trumpâ€™s chance of being elected president. â€œ[Trumpâ€™s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ Page texted Strzok. â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it,â€ Strzok responded. Horowitz&aposs review months ago revealed other anti-Trump texts between the two officials, who were romantically involved. The ""stop"" Trump text goes further, and is likely to fuel claims from the White House that the bureau was working against him. Republican lawmakers pounced on the new text. Video â€œIn Louisiana, we call that bias, we don&apost call that objective,â€ Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on Fox Newsâ€™ â€œOutnumbered Overtimeâ€ on Thursday. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said in a statement the report shows â€œan alarming and destructive level of animus displayed by top officials at the FBI.â€ â€œPeter Strzok&aposs manifest bias trending toward animus casts a pall on this investigationâ€¦His bias impacted his decision making and he assigned to himself the role of stopping the Trump campaign or ending a Trump Presidency,â€ Gowdy said.Â â€œThis is not the FBI I know.â€ But  Bloomberg News , which also reported the new Strzok message, said Horowitzâ€™s report says investigators â€œdid not find documentary or testimonial evidence [in the Clinton case] that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative actions we reviewed.â€ STAGE SET FOR BOMBSHELL IG REPORT ON CLINTON EMAIL CASE For more than a year, Horowitz has been reviewing the FBI and DOJâ€™s actions related to its investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The report is not expected to address the DOJ and FBIâ€™s actions taken in the Trump-Russia investigation, or relitigate the Clinton case itself. But it will mark the most definitive accounting of the email probe to date, looking at -- among other things -- whether â€œcertain underlying investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.â€ The report is set to be released later Thursday. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was seen arriving at the White House, where he was expected to brief Trump on its findings. The inspector generalâ€™s review months ago uncovered a trove of anti-Trump texts from Strzok, who famously called Trump an â€œidiotâ€ and texted about an â€œinsurance policyâ€ against a Trump presidency. Strzok was reassigned to the FBI&aposs human resources division. Page has since left the bureau. A congressional source told Fox News that Pageâ€™s text about Trump â€œnot ever going to become presidentâ€ was produced to Congress, but Strzokâ€™s response that â€œweâ€™ll stop itâ€ was not. According to the Associated Press, the Justice Department&aposs watchdog also faults former FBI Director James Comey for breaking with established protocol in his handling of the Clinton email investigation, but it says his decisions before the 2016 elections were not driven by political bias, according to a person familiar with the findings. The report from the inspector general also criticizes Comey for not keeping his superiors at the Justice Department, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, properly informed about his handling of the investigation, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the report is not yet public.

The White House may insist there is no trade war with American alliesâ€”adviser Peter Navarro has apologized for his ""special place in hell"" slam at Justin Trudeauâ€”but the outcome remains to be seen. But there is one thing that is crystal clear: Donald Trump, after nearly 17 months in office, now is the Republican Party. The latest evidence was the primary defeat of South Carolina congressman Mark Sanford, the former governor whose term was marred by a sex scandal after he was found to have snuck off with his Argentinian mistress. Sanford didnâ€™t lose because of a Trump tweet with hours left in the voting (saying ""he is better off in Argentina""â€”yes, he went there) but because he had criticized the presidentâ€™s policies. This is why most GOP lawmakers are afraid to challenge Trump on just about anything. So if the Republicans in these midterms are now members of the Trumpist Party, what do they have to run on? A great economy, to be sure, cooking along at 3.8 percent unemployment, and a president who excels at the culture war. But what will be the impact of the Singapore summit and the G-7 blowup? As Dan Balz puts it in  The Washington Post , ""The question is, can he gain something politically from these efforts in the absence of demonstrable accomplishments?"" The president, for his part, is blaming the media for not grasping the greatness of the summit: ""So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have &aposbegged&apos for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country&aposs biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!"" First, as someone who wrote a book on the media&aposs overwhelmingly negative coverage of Trump, the press, even the worst press, is not ""our countryâ€™s biggest enemy."" A bigger enemy than Kim Jong Un? Than, what&aposs that guyâ€™s name, Vladimir Putin? I wish the president would stop with this over-the-top rhetoric. Second, Trump has a fair point that some in the press have gone out of their way to denigrate the Kim meeting, as I wrote yesterday. And it&aposs certainly true that he&aposs reduced nuclear tensions by meeting with the North Korean dictator and starting a negotiating process. But the press is right to push back against the presidential declaration that there&aposs no longer a nuclear threat. Kim agreed to nothing specific in the joint statement, just a general goal. All the thorny details about disarmament and inspections and the easing of U.S. sanctions remain to be negotiated. The North Koreans have repeatedly lied about giving up their nukes. And the whole process could eventually collapse, as the president has acknowledged. So it&aposs unlikely there will be tangible results by November. Whatever the president&aposs anger at the coverage, this is not just a product of the liberal media. Erick Erickson, the conservative blogger and radio hostâ€”and a major Trump criticâ€” wrote this yesterday : ""The president pees in the punch bowl of the G7, insists the Russians come back into the organization, then flies off to Singapore to make kissy face with a man who routinely murders his own people. ""Had Barack Obama done that, Republicans would be demanding his impeachment."" But Obama is history and Republicans are now the Trump party. There is ample hypocrisy on all sides. The president deserves credit for getting Kim to the table, but at the moment there is no deal. The press should be held accountable for its double standard, but it is not, repeat not, Americaâ€™s enemy.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-press-over-singapore-as-gop-embraces-his-praise-for-kim,Media Buzz,Fox News,
14/06/2018,2018,6,14,David Bossie,David Bossie on IG report: Some FBI employees desperately wanted to stop Trump from being elected,"close Video IG Report: 'We'll stop' Trump from becoming President 568-page IG report comes at the end of an 18 month investigation; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from the Justice Department. A week ago it was reported that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz would finally be releasing his report on how Obama-era leaders at the department and the FBI badly botched their 2016 investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s serious mishandling of sensitive government emails when she was secretary of state. But it seems that once the release date became public, deep state actors and the Trump-hating media went to work. A strategic leaker fed an unverified rumor to the media Wednesday about President Trumpâ€™s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to distract the public from focusing on the highly inflammatory and damning IGâ€™s report that was issued Thursday. This political tactic is used routinely, but Americans are smart enough to recognize that is was part of the leftâ€™s coordinated witch hunt to take down President Trump. Now that the IG report has been made public, the American people can see the truth for themselves. The truth is that certain high-level bad actors in the FBI wanted desperately to stop candidate Donald Trump from becoming president of the United States. One new text message disclosed in Horowitzâ€™s report is a smoking gun. On August 8, 2016, FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were romantically involved, exchanged a text that confirmed our worst nightmares. â€œ[Trumpâ€™s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ Page texted Strzok. â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it,â€Â  Strzok responded. Think about that. Let those words sink in for a moment. This text exchange shows beyond any doubt that unelected bureaucrats wanted to use their immensely powerful investigative authority to actively try to subvert the will of the people about who should become the next president of the United States. This is high-level government corruption and a direct threat to democracy. No wonder those on the Trump-hating left are doing everything they can to muddy the water. They donâ€™t want the American people to realize that Trump-haters in the deep state were making politically motivated investigative decisions to try to stop a presidential candidate who they opposed. Strzok and Pageâ€™s cover story for the newly disclosed text doesnâ€™t pass muster and is absurd on its face. The new report says they told IG Horowitz that if they truly wanted to effect the presidential election, they wouldnâ€™t have kept the Russia investigation confidential and out of the public domain. The facts tell a different story.  CNN reported Â on August 19, 2016 â€“ 11 days after the texts in question â€“ that â€œFBI and Justice Department prosecutors are conducting an investigation into possible US ties to alleged corruption of the former pro-Russian president of Ukraine, including the work of Paul Manafort&aposs firm, according to multiple US law enforcement officials.â€ One canâ€™t help but wonder about the source or sources of this investigative report. Manafort resigned as chairman of the Trump presidential campaign on the same day the CNNâ€™s report came out. So any negative news about Manafort was clearly designed to hurt Donald Trump, even though there was absolutely no connection between Trump and Manafortâ€™s work on behalf of Ukraine. Hereâ€™s the bottom line: Peter Strzok was intimately involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation. He then went to work for Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation of Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 president election. Strzok was also one of the agents present at then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s interview with the FBI. How can the American people possibly come to a conclusion that these investigations arenâ€™t corrupted by politics? Horowitz also disclosed that another FBI attorney who worked on both the Clinton and Russia investigations â€œleftâ€ the Mueller team earlier this year, after politically biased instant messages were discovered. One of theÂ  shocking messages Â from that attorney seemed to allude to the anti-Trump effort, stating: â€œViva le Resistance.â€ Even highly motivated political operatives inside the FBI failed to produce any evidence pointing to collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign, validating President Trumpâ€™s frequent statement of fact: â€œThere was no collusion.â€ Indeed, the report found ample evidence of  strong  pro-Clinton and anti-Trump political bias inside the FBI. IG Horowitz was troubled enough by the behavior of some FBI employees assigned to the Hillary Clinton email investigation that his report concluded that they â€œcast a cloudâ€ over the probe and â€œsowed doubt the FBIâ€™s work on, and its handling ofâ€ the investigation. The inspector general referred five FBI employees to the FBI to determine whether their actions violate â€œthe FBIâ€™s Offense Code of Conduct.â€ The Horowitz report is extremely troubling and needs to be thoroughly dissected. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray need to take this report to heart and get their houses in order. They should start by firing Peter Strzok.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-bossie-on-ig-report-some-fbi-employees-desperately-wanted-to-stop-trump-from-being-elected,OPINION,Fox News,

President Trumpâ€™s overall job rating is holding steady, buoyed by a record number approving of his handling of the economy.Â  A Fox News poll released Thursday also finds that most like that heâ€™s meeting with North Korea. Forty-five percent of voters approve of the presidentâ€™s performance, while 51 percent disapprove.Â  It was 44-53 percent in April.Â  Trumpâ€™s highest approval, 48 percent, came in February 2017, soon after taking office. READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS. While more voters â€œstrongly disapproveâ€ (41 percent) than â€œstrongly approveâ€ (27 percent), that 14-point intensity gap is down from a high of 24 points in October 2017. The president gets net negative ratings for his handling of immigration (43 percent approve vs. 52 percent disapprove), foreign policy (42-49), and international trade (41-49). A strong jobs report released June 1 showed the U.S. with a seasonally adjusted 3.8 percent unemployment rate.Â  The president seems to get some credit for that.Â  His handling of the economy brings his most positive job ratings, as a record 52 percent approve, while 41 percent disapprove. There was a bump in economic optimism when Trump first took office: the number feeling optimistic went from 49 percent (January 2016) to 66 percent (January 2017).Â  Now, that number sits at 59 percent.Â  Since his inauguration, optimism is up 19 percentage points among Republicans, down 31 points among Democrats, and holding steady among independents. Optimism is increasing on North Korea, as more voters now think it could be convinced to give up its nuclear weapons.Â  Twenty-eight percent feel that way, up 12 points from 16 percent three months ago (March 2018).Â  Still, a majority, 60 percent, says North Korea wonâ€™t let go of its nukes. By a narrow margin, voters think war with North Korea is less likely than it was two years ago (33 percent less likely, 28 percent more likely, 35 percent the same), and most approve of the president meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (66-24 percent). More expect Trump (40 percent) than Kim (30 percent) to negotiate the â€œbetter deal.â€ â€œAmericans have mixed feelings on North Korea.Â  They want the U.S. to negotiate with Kim Jong Un even though they doubt the North Koreans would ever concede on the main sticking point between our countries: nuclear weapons,â€ says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. â€œThey also seem to think President Trump might be able to get a good deal, even though no one has a clue as to what that deal might entail.â€ In March, Trump expressed interest in meeting with Kim and the administration announced May 10 that a U.S.-North Korea summit was in the works for June 12.Â  After being cancelled briefly in late May, the summit is officially back on the schedule. Since March, approval of the summit has ticked up by three points, while the number who think Trump will get the better deal has narrowed by six points. Voters explain why they approve (or disapprove) of President Trump President Trumpâ€™s job rating stands at 45 percent approve vs. 51 percent disapprove. Okay.Â  But why do voters think heâ€™s doing a good job or a bad job? The latest Fox News poll asks voters to explain in their own words what is behind their approval or disapproval of the president.Â  Most could give fairly specific answers, as youâ€™ll see below. The top reasons for approving of President Trump are heâ€™s â€œhelping the economyâ€ (24 percent), â€œgetting things doneâ€ (18 percent), â€œkeeping his promisesâ€ (17 percent), â€œputting America firstâ€ (10 percent), â€œshaking things upâ€ (7 percent), and â€œcutting taxesâ€ (6 percent). Among those disapproving, the most popular reasons are â€œhe doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s doingâ€ (22 percent), â€œhe doesnâ€™t have the temperamentâ€ (20 percent), while others say heâ€™s â€œdivisiveâ€ or â€œracistâ€ (13 percent), â€œcorruptâ€ (9 percent), and â€œliesâ€ (7 percent).Â  Six percent say they are afraid heâ€™ll start a war. â€œOpinions of how the president is doing are underpinned by strong and specific beliefs about the fundamental character of Donald Trump,â€ says Anderson. â€œDonâ€™t expect his approval rating to change unless something happens to challenge core beliefs about him personally.â€ The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,001 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 3-6, 2018.Â  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-record-approval-of-trump-on-economy-optimism-on-north-korea,Fox News Poll,Fox News,
07/06/2018,2018,6,7,Dana Blanton,Fox News Poll: Views remain split over whether Trump coordinated with Russia,"close Video Russia probe clouds Trump's '500 days of American greatness' The economy is booming, the North Korea summit is back on and President Trump is rebuilding the military, but the special counsel's investigation continues to hang over the presidency; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' Majorities of voters think Russia interfered in the 2016 election, President Trump should sit for an interview with the special counsel -- and Congress should not impeach him. The latest Fox News poll finds that by a 56-34 percent margin, voters think Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.Â  Another 60 percent are at least somewhat concerned Russian meddling will affect the outcomes of midterm elections this year.Â  A bipartisan report released by the Senate intelligence committee in May found Russia had attempted to interfere in 2016 and was likely to do so again in 2018. READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS. The numbers are fuzzier on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government:Â  44 percent yes vs. 45 percent no. Even so, over half approve of the investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller (55 percent) and think the president should agree to be interviewed by Mueller (60 percent). When asked if President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, voters say no by a 12-point margin (39 percent yes vs. 51 percent no). Views Among Partisans Opinions on the Russia investigation and its significance have a distinctly partisan flavor.Â  Most Democrats say Trump should be impeached (69 percent), while almost all Republicans (88 percent) and over half of independents (59 percent) say he shouldnâ€™t. The number of Republicans who believe Russia interfered in 2016 is fairly small -- and mostly holding steady.Â  It was 29 percent a year ago, and itâ€™s 27 percent today.Â  Among Democrats, itâ€™s 83 percent, mostly unchanged from last year. Favorable Ratings More voters have a favorable opinion of Trump (45 percent) than of Mueller (37 percent).Â  More also have a negative view of Trump (53 percent) than they do of Mueller (31 percent).Â  A third of voters (33 percent) are unable to rate Mueller. Voters rate former New York City Mayor and current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani negatively with a 34 percent favorable vs. 44 percent unfavorable rating.Â  Still, heâ€™s more popular than Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who garners 18 percent favorable vs. 51 percent unfavorable.Â  Thatâ€™s about the same as controversial comedian Roseanne Barr (24 percent favorable, 57 percent unfavorable).

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Associated Press,Trump's Mideast team gets close-up view of peace obstacles,"
          next

          prev
         Image 2 of 2 AMMAN, Jordan â€“  On their current Mideast tour, senior Trump administration officials are getting a close-up view of some of the towering obstacles to their yet-to-be-released blueprint for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Blockaded Gaza â€” a likely focal point of any future U.S.-endorsed Palestinian entity â€” has been sinking deeper into a humanitarian crisis in recent months, while cross-border violence between Gaza&aposs Hamas rulers and Israel flared again this week. Meanwhile, Hamas rival Mahmoud Abbas, the West Bank-based Palestinian leader, has hardened his rejection of any U.S. proposals, including large-scale Gaza aid projects meant to stabilize the territory. WHAT&aposS THE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP? President Donald Trump&aposs Mideast team, led by son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been tightlipped about the tour, which includes Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel. Kushner and envoy Jason Greenblatt issued vague statements, saying they are talking about the ""humanitarian situation in Gaza"" and U.S. efforts to ""facilitate peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" but didn&apost even release an itinerary. They met Tuesday with Jordan&aposs King Abdullah II and Wednesday with Saudi Arabia&aposs crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, acknowledging the talks only after the fact. They are then expected in Qatar, followed by Israel toward the end of the week. The long-awaited U.S. peace plan isn&apost expected to be unveiled before August, following several postponements. In the meantime, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the envoys are trying to raise up to $1 billion from Gulf countries for economic projects in Gaza and will bring up the idea in meetings this week. ___ WHAT&aposS IN THE U.S. PEACE PLAN? The Kushner team won&apost say. Abbas aides, relying on Saudi information, say they suspect the aim is to get Palestinians to settle for a ""mini-state"" in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, with a foothold in Jerusalem. This would fall far short of long-standing Palestinian demands for a state in the entire West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967, with minor border adjustments. Abbas has shunned the Trump administration since December, after U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&aposs capital, seen by the Palestinians as a blatant show of pro-Israel bias. Abbas says he will reject any peace proposal made by the White House unless it rescinds its Jerusalem decision. It&aposs unlikely the administration can find more amenable Palestinian leaders to work with, even after the 83-year-old Abbas, who has no plans to retire, exits the political stage. ___ WHAT AID HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR GAZA? A blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt, imposed after the 2007 takeover of the territory by the Islamic militant group Hamas, has taken its toll. The economy is largely gutted, with unemployment soaring and electricity dwindling to a few hours a day. Nearly all groundwater has become undrinkable and untreated sewage is pouring into the Mediterranean. Long-standing proposals for large-scale infrastructure projects have gained new momentum amid rising fears of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In March, the European Union said it collected pledges covering 80 percent of more than $650 million needed for a desalination plant and other water projects. U.N. agencies in Gaza would help implement projects on the ground because the international community largely shuns Hamas over its violent anti-Israel ideology. However, Gaza aid plans have been overshadowed by the failure of Egyptian-brokered attempts to reach a deal to return control of the territory to Abbas. Hamas balked at handing over weapons, prompting a decision by Abbas to stay out of Gaza altogether. It&aposs not clear if any Gulf funds raised by Kushner and Greenblatt would be used for existing or additional projects. Haaretz said the U.S. team envisions setting up some of the infrastructure in Egypt, near the border with Gaza. ___ WHY DOES ABBAS OPPOSE AID PLANS? Abbas is suspicious of any U.S. attempts to promote large-scale infrastructure projects in Gaza. He fears that without an acceptable peace framework, such efforts are aimed at pacifying Gaza so it can anchor a Palestinian mini-state. The Palestinian leadership ""will not recognize the legitimacy"" of alleged U.S. plans to ""separate Gaza from the West Bank under the title of humanitarian aid to Gaza,"" an aide, Nabil Abu Rdeneh, said this week. Abbas also fears that investments pouring into Gaza will inadvertently help Hamas stay in power. He has stepped up financial pressure against Hamas in recent months, sharply reducing salary and welfare payments that had helped sustain Gaza&aposs battered economy. In recent days, his security forces fired tear gas and beat West Bank protesters criticizing Abbas&apos policy as callous. ___ HOW DOES GAZA FIGURE INTO ANY PEACE DEAL? For years, Hamas&apos tight grip on Gaza vexed Mideast mediators. Abbas couldn&apost really claim to represent all Palestinians while militants controlled a large area sought for a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, Israel-Hamas tensions remained a constant source of friction, erupting into three cross-border wars between 2008 and 2014, with smaller flare-ups in between. Since late March, Hamas has organized weekly anti-blockade marches near Gaza&aposs perimeter fence with Israel, with some of the protesters burning tires, throwing stones or more recently sending off incendiary kites and balloons that have set Israeli fields on fire. More than 120 Palestinians have been killed and more than 3,800 have been wounded by Israeli army fire, most of them unarmed, according to Gaza health officials. Meanwhile, Israel has begun responding to ""arson kites"" with airstrikes against Hamas targets. Hamas, in turn, fired dozens of rockets and mortar shells toward Israel this week. ___ CAN THE U.S. RELEASE ITS PLAN UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS? The Trump administration, which has good ties with Saudi Arabia and Egypt, appears to be banking on them to pressure the Palestinians to accept the plan. Dan Shapiro, a U.S. ambassador to Israel in the Obama administration, believes the administration must soon spell out its peace plan if it hopes to get Arab states to underwrite large-scale Gaza projects. At the same time, he said, such a plan ""would almost certainly be dead on arrival if it was presented,"" because there&aposs no direct U.S. contact with the Palestinian leadership. Shapiro said it makes more sense to try to ""keep a two-state solution alive by describing the ultimate outcome, without asking the parties to endorse it or come back to the table to negotiate it."" So far, the Trump administration has not explicitly endorsed such a solution, which had served as the basis for peace efforts by its predecessors. ___ Daraghmeh reported from Ramallah, West Bank.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/trumps-mideast-team-gets-close-up-view-of-peace-obstacles,World,Fox News,

          'Reliable Souces' host Brian Stelter
           (LinkedIn) CNNâ€™s in-house media magpie Brian Stelter was ridiculed Wednesday night after bragging on Twitter that his network didnâ€™t air President Trumpâ€™s rally in Duluth, Minn. which occurred hours after he signed an executive order to end the separation of families who cross the border illegally. â€œAs expected, the only cable newsers carrying tonight&aposs Trump rally are Fox News and Fox Biz,â€ Stelter tweeted with a photo of the Fox News coverage. â€œPresident speaks on day of a major story development; and the nation&aposs hall monitor prides self on not covering it,â€ Fox News host Greg Gutfeld tweeted, and Fox Newsâ€™ Geraldo Rivera  responded , â€œThat doesnâ€™t make them wrong.â€ But it wasnâ€™t only Fox stars tweaking Stelterâ€™s tweet. The CNN media reporter was, as the kids say, â€œratioed,â€ which is when negative comments far outnumber the likes and retweets on a particular tweet. A confused follower  asked , â€œAs expected? Cable news is 24/7. Why would you not broadcast a Presidential rally?â€ Another user  responded , â€œWhy isnâ€™t CNN covering the President? Couldnâ€™t you get  @Acosta  to stand in the crowd & scream questions at him?â€ Mocking the  low ratings of CNN  was a common theme, as CNN typically  finishes behind MSNBC  in most measurables. One user  responded , â€œSo you&aposre settling for last place again? Awesome!â€ â€œSome news organizations like folks to hear what our President has to say... unfiltered and unedited,â€ one user responded while dozens mocked CNN as â€œfake news,â€ a term Trump uses when describing the network on a regular basis.  Other responses to Stelterâ€™s tweet included messages such as â€œit would trigger your viewers, they aren&apost used to truth,â€ â€œUnlike CNN, we like to see our President,â€ â€œno one watches youâ€ and â€œmaybe you should try doing real news?â€ Ironically, the crowd at Trumpâ€™s Duluth rally erupted into chants of â€œCNN sucksâ€ at one point.Â While Trump held his rally, CNNâ€™s coverage included Bernie Sanders complaining about the Trump administration and CNN correspondent Jason Carroll reporting on the â€œmental anguishâ€ children can suffer when being separated from their parents. Earlier this month,  Stelter was mocked  for his responses to a tweet President Trump sent regarding media speculation over first lady Melania Trumpâ€™s recent absence from the public eye after he was called out for hypocrisy. â€œThe Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania.

StelterÂ  quoted the presidentâ€™s tweet and wrote , â€œTrump is conflating random Twitter commenters with â€˜the mediaâ€™ here. A common tactic of bad faith critics.

          Ex- Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is not accused of manslaughter despite what ABC News tells viewers.
           Beleaguered ABC News was reeling Thursday morning after having to correct its  latest anti-Trump error  -- an on-screen caption Wednesday afternoon that falsely stated that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump&aposs ex-campaign chief, pleaded guilty to five charges of manslaughter. ABC  quickly apologized  for the error â€“ saying there â€œis no excuseâ€ -- and an ABC spokesperson said the network is still â€œinvestigatingâ€ what went wrong. But ABC News sources tell Fox News that the false report was a â€œpractice chyronâ€ that had likely been maliciously written by a hostile ABC News employee (a chyron is a TV news term for words that appear on the lower third of the screen). The chyron had been written for internal drills and was never supposed to make air. Somehow it did, as producers hastily produced a live â€œspecial reportâ€ on Wednesday. The inaccurate graphic was on air for roughly five seconds and said, â€œManafort pleads guilty to 5 charges of manslaughter.â€ Trump himself criticized ABC News on Wednesday afternoonÂ  in a tweet :Â â€œLook what Fake ABC News put out. I guess they had it prepared from the 13 Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt! #StopTheBias.â€ Manafort has not been charged, or even suspected, of manslaughter or any violent crime. Itâ€™s unclear if ABC has been able to identify the employee who wrote the malicious chyron and if that employee will face sanctions. An ABC staffer who spoke to Fox News on the condition of anonymity said that ABCâ€™s chyrons are usually typed into the computer by unionized employees who are more difficult to discipline or fire due to ironclad labor contracts. To deepen the mystery, itâ€™s unclear how the chyron evaded scrutiny from producers in ABCâ€™s â€œspecial eventsâ€ department, which is in charge of special reports such as the one in which the false report occurred. All chyrons are subject to review on a â€œpreview screenâ€ in ABC Newsâ€™ New York City control room just before being broadcast on air, according to an ABC News insider. During any special event, there are usually at least two ABC News executives in the control room who have decades of experience producing news reports, the insider told Fox News. 
      ABC News allowed a wildly malicious, false graphic to make it on air and the network hasnâ€™t explained who is responsible.
       ABC News did not immediately respond when asked a series of questions, including whether or not the culprit will be disciplined and how many staffers could have prevented the error. â€œThey really donâ€™t have much to do except not to make those kinds of mistakes,â€ an ABC employee said of the special events producers. The employee also pointed to ABC Newsâ€™ phalanx of vice presidents â€œwho are all suddenly not accountable. What do they do all day?"" Media critic and DePauw University professor Jeffrey McCall told Fox News that he cautions his students about doing anything in the newsroom, or any other place, that could cause anyone to question either their seriousness or fairness. â€œThis recent problem at ABC suggests both of these issues could be operative,â€ McCall said. â€œABC has apologized for this problem, but what they really need to explain is how the culture in the newsroom would allow for such a stunt to happen in the first place.â€ â€œABC has apologized for this problem, but what they really need to explain is how the culture in the newsroom would allow for such a stunt to happen in the first place.â€ â€” Media critic Jeffrey McCall  McCall said the gaffe â€œrepresents poor judgment by one wayward chyron writerâ€ but thinks ABC News leadership is to blame. â€œIt alsoÂ suggests that the climate in the ABC News production room allows for such nonsense to happen. Clearly, newsrooms should never be creating fake content in the first place, or have an atmosphere in which even low level staffers are suggesting their biases,â€ McCall said. Itâ€™s the latest embarrassment for ABC News, which has been dogged by accusations of anti-Trump bias and errors in recent months. ABC correspondent Brian Ross famously crashed the financial markets with an inaccurate report about the special counsel looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Earlier this year, â€œThe Viewâ€ co-host Joy Behar was slammed for making offensive comments about Vice President Penceâ€™s Christian faith. 
      ABC Newsâ€™ Brian Ross issued a false report last year on former national security adviser Michael Flynn that impacted financial markets.
       (2016 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.) Trump has publicly criticized ABC News multiple times for the Brian Ross debacle, saying Ross should have been fired (Ross was instead demoted to a sinecure). Trump has alsoÂ  demanded thatÂ DisneyÂ CEO Bob Iger apologize Â â€œfor the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.â€ President-elect Trump even accused ABCâ€™s chief foreign affairsÂ correspondent, Martha Raddatz, of crying on the air on election night (she denies this). Furthermore, ABC News is coming under harsh scrutiny from its own masters at Disney for paying Clinton crony George Stephanopoulos $15 million a year when many industry insiders say the newsman couldnâ€™t possibly command that salary on the open market. This comes as the news division has otherwise been beset by a series of cutbacks and a steady trickle of lay-offs.

W.C. Fields, the great and wise film comedian, once said that doing a scene with children was perilous because they will steal it. Someone should have warned the Trump White House. No doubt buried somewhere inside the administrationâ€™s â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy on illegal border crossings is an important issue related to the rule of law or national sovereignty. Just donâ€™t expect anything resembling serious thought to compete with images of kids in Border Patrol processing cages.

Reassembling these families may slow the bleeding for Republicans, but it wonâ€™t solve anything related to illegal immigration. In 1986, after a mighty legislative struggle during the Reagan administration, Congress passed the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform and Control Act.

President Trump tore into Democratic congressional leaders Thursday after heeding their calls to end family separations at the border, while reserving choice words for Mexico -- which he accused ofÂ â€œtaking our money and sending us drugs.â€ Trump made his withering remarks ahead of a Cabinet meeting at the White House. While he officially invited Democrats to the White House to discuss immigration reform, he lambasted â€œextremist, open borderâ€ lawmakers and accused them of obstruction. The president has been navigating a whirlwind week, responding to national bipartisan outrage over the practice of separating illegal immigrant families by signing an executive order Wednesday stopping it. But Democrats reacted with new demands that the administration curb detentions, leading Trump to cast them as hypocrites given past statements in support of strong borders. ""It&aposs a whole big con job,â€ he said. â€œIn the meantime, people are suffering because of the Democrats."" TRUMP IMMIGRATION ORDER MET WITH SHRUGS, NEW DEMANDS FROM DEMS: &aposTHIS ISN&aposT OVER&aposÂ  As lawmakers in the House mull over a number of immigration proposals that would include a more permanent fix to stop the separation of families, Trump said it would come to naught if Democrats cannot provide the votes in the Senate to get over the 60-vote threshold to break a filibuster. â€œIt takes two to tango,â€ he said, before accusing Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of not caring about the children and choosing instead only to obstruct. Video â€œ[Pelosi and Schumer] don&apost care about the children...they don&apost care about the problems. They don&apost care about anything. All they do is say, &aposObstruct and let&aposs see how we doâ€™ because they have no policies that are any good,â€ he said. Schumer responded to Trumpâ€™s remarks in a tweet, saying that he had backed a bill that would provide â€œ$40 billion for border security and would have been far more effective than the wall.â€ But Trump was particularly angry at Mexico, through which many migrants travel before claiming asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. â€œThey walk through Mexico like itâ€™s walking through Central Park, itâ€™s ridiculous,â€ he said. â€œMexico does nothing for us.â€ He referenced the North American Free Trade (NAFTA) agreement and said one of the reasons he was so tough on it, in addition to it being a â€œterrible dealâ€ for the U.S., was because of the countryâ€™s inaction in helping the U.S. combat illegal immigration. â€œThey encourage people, frankly, to walk through Mexico and go into the United States because they are drug traffickers, theyâ€™re human child traffickers, theyâ€™re coyotes,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re getting some real beauties.â€ â€œMexico is doing nothing for us except taking our money and sending us drugs and doing nothing,â€ he added.â€ The remarks were reminiscent of Trumpâ€™s infamous 2015 campaign launch where he accused Mexico of not â€œsending their best.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re sending people that have lots of problems, and theyâ€™re bringing those problems with us.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Paulina Dedaj,Department of Justice files Flores Agreement modification to fall in line with Trump executive order,"close Video Trump signs executive order halting separation of families at US-Mexico border President Donald Trump signs an executive order halting the separation of families after they crossed into the U.S. illegally. The Department of Justice filed a request Thursday to modify a 1997 order that limits the amount of time children can be detained in an attempt to end family separations at the border. After an outpouring of criticism over the separation of children from their families who illegally enter the U.S., President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to end the controversial practice.  However, the executive action conflicts directly with a 1997 order known commonly as the Flores Agreement that states that children cannot be detained for longer than 20 days with adults. In an attempt to avoid potential lawsuits, the DOJ filed a motion Thursday to â€œprovide limited exemptionâ€ from the agreement, while Congress draws up a more suitable and long term solution. â€œThis Court should provide limited emergency relief in two respects. First, the Court should provide a limited exemption from its construction of the Flores Settlement Agreement&aposs release provisions so that ICE may detain alien minors who have arrived with their parent or legal guardian together in ICE family residential facilities,â€ a press release from the DOJ read. TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STOP FAMILY SEPERATION AT BORDER The second modification asks the Court to exempt ICE family residential facilities from â€œstate licensure requirements.â€ While only a short term solution, the DOJ requested the changes because circumstances have changed since the original order was filed. â€œThese changes are justified by several material changes in circumstances--including the ongoing and worsening influx of families unlawfully entering the United States at the southwest border,â€ the statement said. The Flores Agreement dates back to several lawsuits that were filed against the U.S. government over the treatment of unaccompanied minors under its care.  The final order in 1997 required that children only be released to their parents or legal guardian and that they be placed in the least restrictive conditions. These stipulations that have become a major factor in family separations at the border.  Trump has said that it is loopholes like this that make proper immigration reform impossible and the government is simply enforcing the laws as they are. WATCH: EXECUTIVE IMMIGRATION ORDER: WHY DEMS ARE SLAMMING TRUMP With Congress unable to come to a quick fix, the president has stepped in to resolve the family separations. In addition to Wednesdayâ€™s executive order, Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House to further discuss immigration reform. Fox News also learned Thursday from two defense officials that the Pentagon will support an HHS request to find housing and supply bedding for 20,000 migrant children.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Brian Flood,Hoops legend Kevin McHale slammed for apparently attending Trump rally: â€˜He should never work in the NBA againâ€™,"
          NBA Hall of Famer Kevin McHale is under attack by the left for possibly attending a Trump rally.
           NBA legend and Turner Sports analyst Kevin McHale is being slammed on social media. Not because he made an inflammatory comment, offended a particular group or even unleashed unpopular basketball views. McHale is under fire because it appears he attended a rally for President Trump. A man who appears to be the 6-foot-10 McHale was visible in the background during Trumpâ€™s rally in Duluth, Minn. on Wednesday night and Internet sleuths quickly noticed and decided he shouldnâ€™t be associated with the sport going forward. Sports radio host Henry Lake  wrote , â€œIf Kevin McHale actually showed up to Trumpâ€™s rally in Duluth today with everything that is happening now and what Trumpâ€™s done and stands for, yeah heâ€™s cancelled.â€ A different Kevin McHale, an actor who appeared in â€œGlee,â€  tweeted , â€˜If you&aposre looking for a different Kevin McHale to support, one who most definitely would never attend a Trump rally or align himself with racists, etc., I&aposm still here.â€ Writer Nathaniel Friedman  tweeted that McHale  â€œis extremely stupid for attending a public Trump eventâ€ and that he should â€œnever work in the NBA again.â€ â€œKevin McHale just became the other side of Colin Kaepernick. Hard to see him ever coaching again in the NBA,â€  one writer added  while  another said , â€œHappy draft day to everyone but Kevin McHaleâ€ McHale, a Minnesota native, made seven NBA All-Star Games and was part of three championship teams during the Boston Celtics dynasty in the 1980s. After his Hall of Fame playing career, he held coaching gigs with the Houston Rockets and his hometown Timberwolves. McHaleâ€™s current employer, Turner Sports, declined comment. A company spokesperson declined to confirm whether or not it was actually McHale. The Score editor Chris Walder was â€œdisappointedâ€  with McHale  and  dug up  his wife&aposs pro-Trump Twitter feed. New York Daily News columnist Carron J. Phillips  implied  that people from Boston and Minnesota are  racist . Liberal blog Deadspin published an article headlined, â€œCeltics great Kevin McHale enjoys old feeling of being in an arena full of screaming bigots.â€ Filmmaker Adam Best  wrote , â€œSlap a scarlet letter on Kevin McHale and anybody else still supporting Trump after three years of this BS.â€ Dozens of athletes have spoken out against President Trump and Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry famously said he would not go to the White House if invited (Trump then rescinded the invite). LeBron James made the same claim but his team came up short of the NBA title that typically comes with an invitation. Meanwhile, sports media members such as ESPNâ€™s Jemele Hill have openly criticized the president. ""Every time I think the far left wing in this country mixing sports and politics canâ€™t get any more insane â€” they do."" â€” Author and radio host Clay Travis Author and talk radio host Clay Travis  penned a scathing reaction , in which he mocked anti-Trump personalities over the outrage. â€œEvery time I think the far left wing in this country mixing sports and politics canâ€™t get any more insane â€” they do,â€ Travis wrote on his Outkick the Coverage blog. â€œItâ€™s important to note that LeBron James attended a Hillary Clinton campaign event on the stage and not one person with any kind of audience in the country had any issue with that or even remotely suggested it should impact his job status,â€ Travis added.  â€œThe NBA has, of course, been filled with coaches, among them, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, who have publicly condemned Donald Trump all season long. No one has suggested that they should be fired or rendered unemployable by the NBA for those opinions.â€ McHale did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hoops-legend-kevin-mchale-slammed-for-apparently-attending-trump-rally-he-should-never-work-in-the-nba-again,Media,Fox News,
21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Chad Pergram,"Immigration fight is no picnic: Reps brawl, Dems jeer and cops search for Trump-accosting intern","close Video Rep. Meadows angrily confronts Speaker Ryan on House floor Tensions spill onto House floor over immigration reform; reaction from Fox News political analyst and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. President Trump issued a big executive order Wednesday. He canceled the congressional picnic. Considering the contretemps on Capitol Hill the past few days, itâ€™s no surprise Trump nixed the fete scheduled for the South Lawn of the White House tonight. â€œIt didnâ€™t feel exactly right to me,â€ said the president. The decision comes amid the firestorm over separating migrant children from their parents. Trump noted that lawmakers were struggling with immigration legislation on Capitol Hill. â€œWe&aposll make it another time when things are going extremely well,â€ said the president. Trumpâ€™s decision to postpone the picnic disappointed lawmakers. The picnic is always a bipartisan affair where lawmakers of both parties flock to the White House with their families. The administration transforms the South Lawn into a virtual midway, complete with carnival rides, live music, cotton candy and funnel cake. But people on Capitol Hill werenâ€™t having fun anyway this week. Perhaps itâ€™s better the president axed the soiree. The picnic may have devolved into a gigantic brawl considering how high tensions are running in Congress. Trump headed to the Capitol late Tuesday for a meeting with House Republicans on immigration. House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving escorted the president to the Speakerâ€™s Office. But an unnamed female congressional intern appointed herself to the welcoming committee. Video â€œMr. President, f--- you!â€ shouted the woman from across the Senate side of the Capitol Rotunda. Her expletive hung in the air for a moment, reverberating off the cavernous, cast-iron ceiling. The jeer caught the attention of the U.S. Capitol Police and Secret Service. A call went out on police radios to look for the intern. Officials had a physical description of the intern, but no name. Capitol security authorities and the Secret Service have grown more anxious lately when it comes to protecting the president at the Capitol. The concern intensified last October after a member of the public finagled his way into a giant press scrum outside the Senate chamber, jeered at the president and hurled Russian flags in his path. Fox News is told officials would consider the intern a â€œperson of interestâ€ for a couple of reasons. First, they want to see if sheâ€™s all right mentally -- especially to be working on Capitol Hill with a hard pass which grants access throughout the congressional complex. Second, they need to assess if the intern is really a threat to the president or if her catcall was just political, protected by the First Amendment. If the intern isnâ€™t a threat, authorities would likely leave any disciplinary action up to the office for whom she works. But there is another issue. The intern is granted a hard pass for the Capitol. Itâ€™s not written down anywhere, but some modicum of decorum is expected with that pass. One source suggested to Fox News that itâ€™s problematic if a congressional aide or intern abuses their pass to get close to the president and comport themselves in a political fashion. Thatâ€™s not the purpose of the congressional pass. Video Regardless, decorum was well gone by the time Trump made it to HC-5, a room in the bowels of the Capitol where Republicans usually huddle. During his remarks, Trump homed in on Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who recently lost his primary. The president sarcastically chided Sanford for â€œrunning a great race.â€ Trump then called the congressman a â€œnasty guy.â€ After the meeting, a senior House Republican member who supports the president described the remark as â€œpoor form.â€ Another considered it a â€œlow blow.â€ The president took to Twitter Wednesday, claiming Republicans â€œapplauded and laughed loudlyâ€ when he called out Sanford. â€œIt was ridiculous,â€ said one member of the Freedom Caucus. â€œIt cost him votes (on the immigration bill).â€ One lawmaker complained they never know â€œwhich one of us will get thrown under the bus,â€ adding, â€œhere he is asking for votes and which of us is next?â€ A handful of House Democrats made sure they got in a word edgewise with Trump during his visit to the Capitol. Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham and others crashed the hallway outside the meeting room and waited for the president. When Trump left, the cadre held up signs, waved pictures and hectored him over the child separation policy. Lujan Grisham defended the guerilla tactics. â€œThis is an unusual commander in chief,â€ said Lujan Grisham. â€œThis is a very unique set of circumstances and it requires a unique set of extraordinary efforts.â€ A few minutes later, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., was in another hallway speaking in front of cameras from all five TV networks. Thatâ€™s when Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., confronted Curbelo in mid-interview. â€œI hope you tell them not to put people in cages, Carlos,â€ said Vargas to his colleague. â€œYou were the one we were hoping on and you havenâ€™t helped us out on this, Carlos.â€ â€œI wish that you would have been upset when the Obama administration had children in cages,â€ retorted Curbelo. Video â€œYou guys are lying about it,â€ shot back Vargas. Whatâ€™s gone on this week at the Capitol is anything but politesse. Itâ€™s no surprise that late Wednesday, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., excoriated House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the floor while members watched in shock. Itâ€™s rare for lawmakers to publicly argue with one another. Itâ€™s another strata to upbraid the speaker of the House  on the floor . Meadows accused Ryan of duping lawmakers about the real contents of immigration legislation before the House. It is said you bring your own weather to a picnic. Maybe itâ€™s smart the president canceled the cookout. With the way things are going this week at the Capitol, tornadic supercells would have likely spun through the South Lawn.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Associated Press,AP-NORC Poll: Majority approve of Trump's North Korea effort,"WASHINGTON â€“  A majority of Americans now approve of President Donald Trump&aposs handling of U.S. relations with North Korea, a change that comes after his historic summit with that country&aposs leader, Kim Jong Un. But most don&apost believe Kim is serious about addressing the international concerns about his country&aposs nuclear weapons program. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released Thursday finds that 55 percent of Americans approve of Trump&aposs diplomacy with North Korea, up from 42 percent in March and 34 percent last October. It&aposs the highest rating for the Republican president on any individual issue on an AP-NORC poll since his inauguration. The survey was conducted immediately after Trump concluded a one-day meeting with Kim, the first between a U.S. and North Korean leader in six decades of hostility, at which they agreed North Korea would work toward denuclearization in exchange for U.S. security guarantees. The positive feelings about the summit among Americans don&apost appear to have made a dent in Trump&aposs overall approval rating, which stands at just 41 percent and has not significantly changed since March. As the poll was being conducted, Trump was embroiled in controversy over his administration&aposs policy of separating children from their parents after border agents catch the families crossing into the U.S. illegally. Yet even people unhappy with Trump overall are willing to admire his efforts at detente with North Korea. Last September, Trump taunted Kim as ""Rocket Man"" in a speech at the United Nations, during which he vowed to ""totally destroy North Korea"" if the U.S. was forced to defend itself or its allies. Last week, after meeting with Kim, he tweeted, ""there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea."" ""I hate to give Donald Trump any credit, but the fact is he was able to sit down with the man and possibly get the volume of that threat turned down significantly,"" said Susan Leo, 66, a retired minister from Santa Cruz, California, who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. Still, she added, when she considers the big picture, Trump&aposs presidency is ""a nightmare. There&aposs absolutely no integrity in his life and in his presidency overall."" Leo isn&apost alone in having such split views of the president. While only 9 percent of Democrats and 37 percent of independents approve of how Trump&aposs performance as president overall, 31 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents approve of his work with North Korea. Americans also have mixed feelings about Trump&aposs announcement that he would end military exercises with South Korea while negotiations with North Korea are ongoing, with about 3 in 10 in favor and 3 in 10 opposed. Even as they broadly give Trump solid reviews for the summit, Americans remain skeptical about what sort of deal he may ultimately reach with a country controlled by what he once called a ""depraved regime."" Trump&aposs critics have responded to his confidence in the agreement struck with Kim at the summit with reminders that North Korea has never signed such a deal that it didn&apost later break. A majority of Americans â€” 52 percent â€” have little to no confidence that negotiations with Kim will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons, while just 12 percent are very or extremely confident. Fifty-five percent think North Korea isn&apost serious about addressing international concerns about its nuclear weapons program. Roger D&aposAquin, a retired security manager from New Orleans who voted for libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in 2016, said that he thought Trump&aposs tactics with Kim worked, but added, ""I have no confidence that Kim wants to cooperate and wants to get rid of his nukes."" ""Overall Trump handled that well,"" said D&aposAquin, 50, who said he was happy Trump won the election and that he gave him a ""C&apos&apos for the job so far. Even among Republicans, just 25 percent say they&aposre very confident that North Korea will eventually agree to a deal to give up its nuclear weapons. A large majority of Democrats have little confidence the Kim regime will ever do so. Trump&aposs meeting with Kim came on the heels of his combative G-7 meeting with traditional U.S. allies, including Canada and the United Kingdom. After departing that gathering in Quebec, Trump attacked Justin Trudeau as ""dishonest"" and ""weak"" after the Canadian prime minister told reporters his government would retaliate against new U.S. tariffs it viewed as unfair. Only 43 percent of Americans approve of Trump&aposs handling of relationships with U.S. allies or of his handling of trade negotiations with other countries, a figure that&aposs similar to his overall approval rating. Just 23 percent of Americans say they&aposre very or extremely confident in his ability to handle complex foreign policy situations, while 53 percent are not very or not at all confident. Asked about Trump&aposs potential options at the negotiating table in future talks with North Korea, more Americans say they&aposd oppose than favor withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea (41 percent to 29 percent) and giving economic aid to North Korea (47 percent to 24 percent) in exchange for Kim surrendering his country&aposs nuclear weapons. More Americans favor than oppose ending sanctions designed to limit North Korea&aposs economy (37 percent to 27 percent), and a large majority â€” 69 percent â€” say they&aposd favor a treaty marking an official end to the Korean War. There&aposs even some support for inviting Kim to the White House, with 39 percent of Americans open to an idea that 25 percent oppose. Kim Oldfield, 67, of Culverville, California, a registered Independent who voted for Trump, said she was fine Kim coming to Washington as part of a nuclear deal. ""Sure, why not,"" she said. ""There&aposs a first time for everything."" ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,109 adults was conducted June 13-18 using a sample drawn from NORC&aposs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

Well, Iâ€™m not going to say the words Barack Obamaâ€¦â€ he said at the Cannes Film Festival. â€œThereâ€™s no room any more for a sissy and, like I said, donâ€™t forget that Iâ€™ve got grandsons who Iâ€™ve trained with long-distance rifles,"" Fonda repeated. ""We have to run like [expletives] to change this world.â€ The star, at the time, was promoting his movie â€œThe Big Fix,â€ a documentary critical of the Obama administrationâ€™s handling of the infamous BP Gulf oil spill. Fonda claimed at the timeÂ that he ""sent an email to President Obama saying, &aposYou are a f---ing traitor,&apos using those words... &aposYou&aposre a traitor, you allowed foreign boots on our soil telling our military -- in this case the Coast Guard -- what they can and could not do, and telling us, the citizens of the United States, what we could or could not do.&apos"" Fonda is an accomplished actor with over a hundred film and TV credits. Heâ€™s been nominated for two Oscars for his role in â€œEasy Riderâ€ and â€œUleeâ€™s Gold.â€ After the Secret Service revealed the organization had been notified about Fondaâ€™s tweets, the 78-year-old expressed regret for his statement about the presidentâ€™s 12-year-old son. ""I tweeted something highly inappropriate and vulgar about the president and his family in response to the devastating images I was seeing on television. Like many Americans, I am very impassioned and distraught over the situation with children separated from their families at the border, but I went way too far,"" he told Fox News. ""It was wrong and I should not have done it. I immediately regretted it and sincerely apologize to the family for what I said and any hurt my words have caused."" Fondaâ€™s latest film, â€œBoundaries,â€ is set to be released on Friday. Fonda canceled an appearance at a press junket in Los Angeles to promote the movie on Wednesday following the backlash. Sony, the studio behind the movie, issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the actor&aposs tweets. â€œPeter Fondaâ€™s comments are abhorrent, reckless and dangerous, and we condemn them completely,â€ Sony  stated . â€œIt is important to note that Mr. Fonda plays a very minor role in the film.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Adam Shaw,Trump immigration order met with shrugs and new demands from Dems: 'This isn't over',"close Video Executive immigration order: Why Dems are slamming Trump Executive immigration order: What does it entail and why are Dems bashing it?  After demanding for days that President Trump end the separation of illegal immigrant families at the border, Democrats responded to his executive order stopping the practice with only new appeals -- drawing GOP accusations that they&aposre more interested in using the issue as a political cudgel. The president, rarely one to back down from a fight, signed the order Wednesday allowing children to stay with parents caught crossing the border illegally. The move followed national outrage over the impact of the Justice Department&aposs â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy referring all illegal border crossers for prosecution. Children were separated due to a 1997 order and related decisions that forbid them from being detained with adults for extended periods. For a solid week, the administration was pilloried by Democrats, journalists, activists and even members of his own party. Trump sought to ease the outrage with his order. But, keen to show his base he&aposs not softening on immigration either, he vowed to continue the ""zero tolerance"" approach, while calling on Congress to seek a more lasting fix. Democrats were not impressed. Within minutes of Trump&aposs oversized signature being displayed for the cameras, they turned their focus to the â€œindefinite imprisonment of families.â€ â€œThis Executive Order doesnâ€™t fix the crisis. Indefinitely detaining children with their families in camps is inhumane and will not make us safe,â€ Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted: â€œThis isnâ€™t over.â€ â€œSeparating kids is unacceptable â€“ but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel & inhumane,â€ she said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that such detention was â€œextremely troublingâ€ and the order was â€œthe next step in the Trump administrationâ€™s larger agenda to eliminate basic protections for asylum seekers.â€ â€œLet us be clear that the executive order that he issued together goes nowhere, nowhere, nowhere as far as it should go,â€ Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on the Senate floor, before echoing the concerns about detaining families together. â€œIs that better than them being separated from their parents? I guess,â€ Sanders shrugged. â€œBut does anyone really believe we should be imprisoning for an indefinite period of time, little children?â€ Republicans countered that families are not actually being held indefinitely and are going through due process. Further, they cited the Democratic shrug-off as proof that they were trying to keep the issue hot for the November midterms. â€œEven though the president resolved the family separation issue on a temporary basis, they condemn him for that,â€ Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said on â€œFox & Friends.â€ â€œI donâ€™t think they have any interest in working constructively with us but rather use this in the 2018 midterm elections.â€ Video â€œThe ink isnâ€™t even dry on the new executive order ending separation policy & some Democrats already arguing that keeping families together isnâ€™t enough,â€ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted. â€œNow they want them & their parents released after unlawful entry knowing full well that high % will never appear for hearing.â€ He also called claims that the U.S. would be detaining immigrant children indefinitely â€œpatently false.â€ Trump also responded to the outrage, calling for Democratic leaders to come to the table and do a ""real deal."" ""Schumer used to want Border security -- now he&aposll take crime,"" Trump tweeted, while highlighting past Democratic tough talk on immigration.Â  The Democratic outrage following the executive order was echoed by allies in liberal media and activist groups.Â  â€œYay, no more baby internment camps,â€ said Samantha Bee, host of â€œFull Frontal.â€ â€œJust regular internment camps. Cool, thatâ€™s what we call a win in 2018!â€ â€œMommy and me jails are not a solution,â€ she said, before urging her audience to â€œkeep fighting.â€ Democrats also expressed concern about the more than 2,000 children separated before the executive order went into effect, and whether they would be reunited with their families. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the order a ""relief"" but said that he hopes that the children are quickly reunited. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement: ""For those children still in Border Patrol custody, we are reuniting them with parents or legal guardians returned to Border Patrol custody following prosecution."" The call for family reunification became a bipartisan issue in recent days, and the administration may still face bipartisan pressure to ensure the children in custody are brought back with their parents. But Republicans bristled at suggestions that the families should simply be released. Meanwhile, protesters signaled the executive order would do little to calm the tensions in the streets. In Portland, ICE offices were to remain closed on Thursday due to left-wing protesters occupying the area outside the office.Â  In New York, demonstrators flocked to La Guardia airport after reports on social media that separated children might be arriving on flights. An American Airlines spokesman told  The New York Times  that a flight was delayed from Texas until the airline was assured that a group of seven teenage boys were not separated from their parents.

           (Fox News) President Trump mocked a protester over his man-bun as he was booted from a rowdy rally in Duluth on Wednesday night. ""Was that a man or a woman? Because he needs a haircut more than I do,"" Trump said as the protester was escorted out by security. ""I couldn&apost tell. Needs a haircut."" The protester, who with another person was holding a picture of Trump, was removed from the Amsoil ArenaÂ in Duluth, Minn., to chants of â€œUSA! USA!

Trump immigration order met with shrugs and new demands from Dems: â€˜This isnâ€™t overâ€™ Like Bush and Obama, Trump gets stuck on immigration The demonstrator was later identified as Sam Spadino.  The Duluth News Tribune reported Â he traveled two and a half hours from Minneapolis along with friend Kelly Richard with the goal of getting inside the rally and disrupting it. When they were about 15 feet from the president, they began to yell and call him a rapist before security removed them. Richard told local media that as security was taking her away, Trump supporters spat on her and yelled. ""It was sick,"" Richard said. ""It was disgusting to see people support this man."" Video Coming only hours after Trump signed an executive order stopping the controversial practice of separating children from parents who came to this country illegally, the president and his supporters were met with numerous protests during his brief visit to Minnesota. More than 1,000 people marched past the arena on Wednesday, drawing taunts and middle fingers from some Trump supporters. And following the speech, two protesters were handcuffed after they refused to stop yelling at and crowding a supporter of the president outside the arena. The two were cited and released â€“ one for disorderly conduct and the other for obstructing the legal process. Despite the protests, Duluth police said the day remained relatively civil as thousands of supporters greeted the president in the arena. â€œThousands of people and overwhelming civility was a good day for Duluth,â€ Police Chief Mike Tusken wrote on Facebook. The Duluth rally was Trump&aposs first in a blue state since taking office. He narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016. And with the industrial and upper Midwest looming large for Trump&aposs re-election hopes, the president vowed to spend more time there before 2020.

          Reaction to President Trumpâ€™s executive order proves he cannot win when it comes to the mainstream media.
           (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) The reaction to President Trump&aposs executive order on Wednesday, which will allow parents who have crossed the U.S. border illegally to remain with their children, served as a microcosm of how he simply cannot win when it comes to the mainstream media. â€œItâ€™s nearly impossible for this president to please his critics. In this case, heâ€™s reversing his policy that separates these migrant families, but Democrats and the media immediately move the goal post, saying that what heâ€™s doing isnâ€™t enough,â€ Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn told Fox News. â€œItâ€™s nearly impossible for this president to please his critics. In this case, heâ€™s reversing his policy that separates these migrant families, but Democrats and the media immediately move the goal post saying that what heâ€™s doing isnâ€™t enough."" â€” Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn After weeks of calling for Trump to take action, he signed the order allowing children to stay in detention with their parents for an extended period of time. The order came after he and other officials repeatedly said only Congress had the power to stop children and their parents from being separated. Trumpâ€™s executive order wasnâ€™t good enough for his critics. CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper opened his show by asking, â€œWhy didnâ€™t he do this 2,000 kids ago?â€ Tapper would go on to speculate that Trump â€œdidnâ€™t really soundâ€ like he wanted to sign the executive order, while other CNN pundits criticized the president by saying that he didnâ€™t actually need to sign an executive order to end the policy. CNNâ€™s Don Lemon called Trump â€œshamefulâ€ and said he only â€œcavedâ€ when heartbreaking photos emerged before defending Democrats â€“ who the Trump administration has blamed for the law. â€œZero tolerance has nothing to do with Democrats. It was this White House that decided to prosecute every single adult crossing the border illegally,â€ Lemon  said , perhaps not realizing what the term â€œillegallyâ€ means. Since Trump signed the order, CNNâ€™s on-screen chyrons have been snarky and condescending, such as â€œExecutive order ending family separation creates new chaosâ€ and â€œTrump caves on his own family separation policy.â€ MSNBCâ€™s Lawrence Oâ€™Donnell mocked Trump for generating headlines such as â€œTrump caves,â€ and spent a significant chunk of his primetime program looking for loopholes and flaws in the order. ""Now that the kids would be allowed to stay with their families, the networks were huffing and puffing about kids being in jail.â€ â€” NewsBusters analyst Nicholas Fondacaro â€œFor the last week, the liberal media were concerned about the Trump administration separating kids while their parents were being detained. But now that the kids would be allowed to stay with their families, the networks were huffing and puffing about kids being in jail,â€ NewsBusters analyst Nicholas Fondacaro  wrote . â€œCBS Evening Newsâ€ anchor Jeff Glor ranted that Trump was trying to â€œput out a big political fire with a few drops of ink,â€ while NBCâ€™s Jacob Soboroff harped on the fact that reunited families would continue to be detained. â€œFrankly, we do not know how long these families will be detained together. What we do know is that children that were held alone in facilities like this will now be housed with their parents.Â Historically the length of those family detentions could be up to 20 days long,â€Â SoboroffÂ said. ABCâ€™s â€œWorld News Tonightâ€ anchor David Muir said the executive order leads to new questions and asked, â€œHow long can the Trump administration detain entire families?â€ ABC News even  sent a misleading Tweet , captioning a clip of Trump saying, ""We&aposre sending them the hell back,"" with news about the executive order â€“ when the president was actually referring to the brutal MS-13 gang.  Wulfsohn said that itâ€™s a â€œpolitical strategyâ€ for liberal pundits to â€œalways be upset at Trump,â€ even if they get what they want. â€œThey will still express manufactured outrage in order to push their agenda,â€ Wulfsohn said. Late night comedians also used the executive order as an excuse to mock the president. Stephen Colbert played a clip of Trump saying he doesnâ€™t like the idea of families being separated â€“ something liberals have called for him to say â€“ and then sneered that Trump makes everything about himself. Colbert said Trump signing the order â€œmade it look like he did something good instead of admitting to ending the evil thing he started.â€ Samantha Bee joked, â€œYay! No more baby internment camps, just regular internment campsâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what we call a win in 2018.â€ â€œItâ€™s always been about cynical emotional manipulation... Itâ€™s one of the most shameful chapters in our modern mediaâ€™s history."" â€” Conservative strategist Chris Barron  Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that it was â€œnever about the policyâ€ and it wasnâ€™t even about children or families. â€œItâ€™s always been about cynical emotional manipulation. Manufacturing a crisis, stoking hysteria and even condoning violence, all in the name of getting clicks and viewers. Itâ€™s one of the most shameful chapters in our modern mediaâ€™s history,â€ Barron said.

         Image 2 of 2 SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador â€“  Nightfall in El Salvador&aposs capital was fast approaching and Ernesto Pena was waiting for a bus that never arrived. His work day delivering rice and cooking oil to street vendors in the bustling district of Santa Tecla had ended and like most people he was anxious to get home before the gangs that control the poor neighborhood where he lives enforce an informal curfew. For years, he and his wife have been saving what they can on their combined $700-a-month income to one day pay smugglers to ferry them and their 8-year-old son to what they hope will be a safer future in the U.S. But the searing images displayed across local newspapers this week of children held in fenced cages after being separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border has led the 30-year-old to rethink his plans to journey northward. ""We&aposve always thought about going but we haven&apost been able to scavenge together enough money,"" said Pena, looking around nervously out of fear a gang lookout might spot him talking to a journalist. ""And now we have to think about this,"" he added, referring to what he worries could be a cruel reception if he manages to reach the U.S. The same feeling of desperation and impotence is being felt throughout Central America, where the lawlessness, endemic poverty and levels of gang violence akin to war zones that have driven so many families from their homes show little signs of abating, despite the Trump administration&aposs policy of ""zero tolerance"" toward illegal immigrants. The rate of violent death in El Salvador is still higher than all countries suffering armed conflict except for Syria, with a murder rate of 99.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, according to the most recent global study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. The number of people displaced in the nation of 6.5 million by turf battles between the country&aposs two biggest gangs, MS-13 and Barrio 18, skyrocketed last year to 296,000, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. In neighboring Honduras, one of Latin America&aposs poorest and most violent nations, adding to the sense of insecurity is the country&aposs role as a major transit point for South American cocaine as well as the political turmoil and civil unrest that have followed hard-line President Juan Orlando Hernandez&aposs re-election last November amid allegations he stole the vote. In Guatemala â€” the third of the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Central America â€” criminal activity is also spreading, adding to the discrimination and abuse long faced by the indigenous communities that are among the largest groups fleeing poverty. ""This isn&apost about immigrants chasing the American dream anymore,"" said Sofia Martinez, a Guatemala-based analyst for the International Crisis Group and author of a recent report on gang violence in Central America, ""Mafia of the Poor."" ""It&aposs about escaping a death sentence,"" she said. President Donald Trump&aposs crackdown on illegal migrants could end up worsening the security and economic situation in Central America, Martinez said, leading even more people to flee in the future. Earlier this year, he ended temporary protected status for 57,000 Hondurans and 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants, some of whom have been living in the U.S. for decades. If deported, they&aposll return to countries ill-equipped to absorb them and generating too few jobs to provide opportunities to work. The violence driving so many people from their homes has been emerging for decades. Civil wars that engulfed the region during the Cold War left a legacy of weak institutions that criminals have been quick to exploit. The gangs themselves were formed in rough Los Angeles neighborhoods as a form of self-protection and rapidly expanded after tens of thousands of suspected gang members, mainly Salvadorans, were deported back to their countries of origin in the 1990s, only to find limited job prospects and stigmatization for their criminal pasts and out-of-place ""Spanglish."" ""At first they would just fight among each other, whipping each other with belts. But now they have guns and bullets,"" said Carmen Siguenza, 52, who sent her two children, now in their 20s, to live in the U.S. when they were teenagers so they wouldn&apost be recruited by the gangs. She and her husband have thought about joining them many times, but in the wake of Trump&aposs crackdown she&aposs now afraid that she would get caught. ""If I were younger, I wouldn&apost think twice about leaving because it&aposs the youth the gangs bother, not us older folks,"" she said. Iron-fisted policing tactics have only exacerbated the carnage without addressing the underlying social ills contributing to the gangs&apos expansion. Honduras in 2002 even called its crackdown a name Trump himself would come to embrace: ""Zero Tolerance."" When thousands of gang members were thrown into jail, their leadership structures become more sophisticated and extortion rackets proliferated from behind bars. In rural areas and cities alike, the threat of violence is never far away, even though homicide rates in the three countries have fallen from their peaks. Just entering certain neighborhoods in San Salvador requires paying a bribe to youth lookouts. Last year, 35 bus drivers, passengers and fare collectors were killed while riding buses into gang-controlled neighborhoods, while those that were spared a bullet were extorted to the tune of $19 million, according to the Salvadoran public transport owners&apos association. The sense of helplessness is one reason the number of families with children attempting to cross into the U.S. has also been spiking even as overall illegal migration hovers near a two-decade low. Following Trump&aposs inauguration, the number of Central Americans passing through Mexico to the U.S. sharply dropped on fears that Trump&aposs caustic rhetoric could translate into more abuse and deportations, combined with enhanced enforcement begun under the Obama administration. But what migration experts like to call the ""Trump effect"" appears to be fading as the U.S. economy purrs at near full employment levels and the criminal networks that take migrants across the border adapt. So far this year, the number of apprehensions along the Mexican border has risen every month, and in May reached 40,344 â€” still a far cry from the record levels seen in 2000 but almost three times what it was a year ago. At the same time, the number of families entering the U.S. illegally at the southwest border jumped six-fold in May to 9,485 compared with the same month in 2017. Since October, more than 57,000 have arrived, the bulk from Guatemala followed by Honduras. More than 2,300 minors have been separated from their parents since April, when the Trump administration launched its ""zero-tolerance"" policy that called for prosecuting illegal immigrants and taking their children away. On Wednesday, Trump abruptly reversed himself and signed an executive order halting the practice. For now, the media ruckus and international outrage caused by the policy is likely to deter more Central Americans from leaving home, said Andrew Selee, president of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute. ""It&aposs a blunt response but it&aposs probably very effective,"" he said. But longer term, as long as bloodshed and poverty continue to shape peoples&apos lives, it&aposs only a matter of time before another wave emerges, Selee said. On Wednesday, 18-year-old Cecilia Tojin was among around 250 deported illegal migrants who arrived in Guatemala City on two chartered flights paid for by U.S. taxpayers. She was detained upon arriving in Arizona on May 14 after a two-month journey that involved going hungry and sleeping in the freezing Sonora desert of northern Mexico. Despite the hardships, she said she&aposs determined to try again. The roughly $8,000 she borrowed against her parents&apos house to pay smugglers, known as coyotes, entitles her to one more attempt. ""I&aposm not afraid,"" she said between tears as she walked through the door of the air base where many of the other deportees scurried by with their faces covered. ""I&aposve got another chance and I&aposm going to go again."" ___ Goodman reported from Bogota, Colombia.

First lady Melania Trump on Thursday visited a child detention center in Texas that houses minors who entered the country illegally -- in the wake of her husbandâ€™s executive order that ended the practice of separating families. Mrs. Trump visited the Upbring New Hope Childrenâ€™s Center, after she was reported to have been a force in getting the president to act in the wake of a days-long controversy surrounding the effects of the Department of Justiceâ€™s â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy. The first lady said earlier through her spokeswoman that she ""hates"" to see families separated at the border. â€œWe all know they are here without their families and I want to thank you for your hard work, compassion and kindness you are giving them in these difficult times,â€ Mrs. Trump told a roundtable of workers at the Texas center. Video She went on to meet with children, shaking hands with some and asking what their favorite school subjects are. She told a group of boys to ""work hard, study hard"" and another group to ""be kind and nice to each other."" Another classroom was decorated by a large homemade American flag with ""Welcome First Lady!"" on it. President Trump, meanwhile, said at a Cabinet meeting in Washington that his wife was at the border ""because it really bothered her to look at this and be seeing it, as it bothered me and it bothered everyone at this table."" The president continued, however, to stress the importance of border security.Â ""They walk through Mexico like it&aposs Central Park. It&aposs ridiculous,"" he said. ""Mexico is doing nothing except taking our money and sending us drugs."" But the past two days have seen the Trump administration, and Republicans in Congress, try to strike a balance in their approach to border prosecutions. Workers in Texas told the first lady on Thursday that the center deals primarily with unaccompanied minors, as opposed to those separated from their families at the border. One said that the average time for a child to be reunited to members of their families was between 42 and 45 days. Facility officials said that there were 55 children at the facility, most within the 12-17 age range although they are licensed to care for children as young as 6. In cases where children don&apost have a home to go to, legal services will assess and they may be given refugee status. Her office said in a statement Thursday: ""Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families."" Trump signed the executive order on Wednesday saying that that parents and children should be held together, although the ""zero tolerance"" policy remains in place. Democrats have expressed concern that this could lead to the indefinite detention of families. They have also called on the Trump administration to make sure currently separated children are reunited with their parents as soon as possible.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Dan Backer,I was a childhood immigrant to the US -- Trump is acting wisely and compassionately on illegal immigration,"close Video Trump signs order to keep families together at border President Trump and Vice President Pence speak after Trump signs executive order to let immigrant families stay together after crossing the U.S. border. As a legal immigrant brought to America by my parents when I was a baby, I was particularly upset when I saw illegal immigrant parents and children being separated when they crossed into the U.S. in recent days. But I was happy when President Trump did the right thing andÂ  signed an executive order Â Wednesday allowing parents who have crossed the border illegally to remain with their children. Children should not be made to suffer for the actions of their parents. President Trump has compassion for these children. So does first lady Melania Trump, who  showed this Thursday  by visiting a detention center in Texas for children who entered the U.S. illegally. At the same time, I applaud the president for holding firm on his â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy and criminally prosecuting any immigrants who come to the U.S. in violation of our laws. This sends a powerful message to all who disrespect our laws.Â   The presidentâ€™s actions â€“ and the actions of Republicans in Congress â€“ make me proud to be a Republican and proud that I voted for Donald Trump and continue to support him.  I understand why people want to come to America from other countries. My family fled the oppression of the Soviet Union when I was a baby for a chance at a better life â€“ the chance at freedom, opportunity and prosperity. America has treated us well and Iâ€™m grateful and proud to be a U.S. citizen. As lucky as I am to have been admitted to the U.S., I understand that we canâ€™t simply ignore our immigration laws and throw open our borders to everyone around the world who would like to move here. As lucky as I am to have been admitted to the U.S., I understand that we canâ€™t simply ignore our immigration laws and throw open our borders to everyone around the world who would like to move here. There might be more people outside the U.S. who want to immigrate to America than there are people living here today â€“ obviously more than we could suddenly take in. We need a thoughtful, selective, meritocratic immigration policy to decide who can come and on the whole add the most to our nation. President Trump is taking a balanced and reasonable approach to enforce the immigration laws passed by prior Congresses and signed into law â€“ but often ignored â€“ by previous presidents. And the president is not the only Republican who is working to improve our immigration system. Shortly after the governmentâ€™s treatment of illegal immigrant children entered the news cycle, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,  proposed legislation  doubling the number of federal immigration judges from the current roughly 375 to 750. The Cruz proposal would speed up the processing of illegal immigrants and reduce detention time, and would bar the separation of immigrant children from their parents.  Other Senate Republicans also advanced proposals. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,  introduced a bill Â that would keep families together while they are undergoing prosecution for breaking the law or waiting for decisions on their asylum requests.Â  In his words : â€œAll of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together.â€  Before signing his executive order, President Trump voiced support for the McConnell plan, but went even further for the sake of border security. The Trump administration alsoÂ  demanded $25 billion to fully fund the border wall  â€“  sticking by Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign promises. The border wall is essential. We cannot solve the problem of immigrants crossing our border illegally until we secure the border.  President Trump understands the wrong approach is to double down on blanket amnesty, which Democrats and establishment Republicans continue to do. House Speaker Paul Ryan R-Wis., hasÂ  proposed to legalize at least 1.8 million illegal immigrants Â who are here under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The proposal is supported by the likes of Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and other â€œNever Trumpers,â€ who care more about the interests of illegal immigrants than American citizens and immigrants here legally.  And what are Democrats bringing to the table? Obstruction, obstruction and more obstruction. Theyâ€™ve also taken toÂ  publishing fake photos and bogus facts Â to drive their â€œresistanceâ€ to President Trump.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  slammed Â the McConnell plan to reunite immigrant children and parents, claiming it would â€œenact the hard rightâ€™s immigration agenda.â€ Schumer urged the Trump administration to solve the problem unilaterally â€“ which is exactly what the president did with his executive order.  Ironically, Senate Democrats asked President Trump to fix what President Obama broke. DACA and other Obama administration programs encouraged illegal immigrants to flood our southern border, even as the Obama administration pursued the same policy of prosecuting illegal immigrants for crossing the border and separating their families.  The Obama administration prosecutedÂ  nearly 493,000 illegal immigrants  â€“  a fact the left-leaning mainstream media routinely ignores. Detention centers existed under President Obama â€“ something the liberal media also ignores.  The bottom line is this: We can enforce our immigration laws without separating children from their families. We can secure our borders without slamming our doors on all immigrants, as long as we prioritize welcoming those who come here legally.   When my parents came here with me from the Soviet Union, they did so legally. They waited their turn because they wanted us to be a part of this beautiful country. They didnâ€™t flee the horrors of communist Russia because they wanted to make America communist. No immigrant can both reap the benefits of the rule of law and simultaneously ignore the rule of law. To fully participate in our free-market system â€“ and join us in keeping America great and making it greater â€“ each and every immigrant should come here legally. Those who seek to break our laws as their first act of â€œbeing Americanâ€ are simply dragging America into the same sad state of corruption and lawlessness they fled in the first place.  We can solve the immigration problem â€“ fully and finally. Republicans have put solutions on the table. Democrats should join them in solving the problem instead of simply using it to attack President Trump and the GOP for political purposes.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-was-a-childhood-immigrant-to-the-us-trump-is-acting-wisely-and-compassionately-on-illegal-immigration,OPINION,Fox News,"

She shared the photo with two other women nearby. â€œIf it comes to a choice between crossing and losing my kids Iâ€™ll keep my kids,â€ said a woman in a purple fleece sweater. â€œI donâ€™t want to be separated from my kids.â€ The women gathered at what is called â€œEl Chaparral Gateâ€ at the U.S. port of entry in San Ysidro south of San Diego. By 8 a.m., the plaza is full of migrants waiting to request asylum. Men, women and children. From Africa, Central America, and Asia.

Three men from the West African nation spent four months traveling from Cameroon to Panama by boat, then by bus to Tijuana. They have been in Tijuana four weeks waiting for an asylum interview. â€œSomeone want to kill me,â€ said his older friend who also made the trip. â€œI donâ€™t believe the Unites States wants to let that happen.â€ Most here are economic migrants. They may be fleeing poverty and violence but embellish stories of persecution hoping to qualify for asylum. Itâ€™s up to an immigration judge to separate fact from fiction. But among those who cross illegally, the first to hear the fraud â€“ are border patrol agents. 
      While President Trump lifted his policy separating parents and children in custody, he still wants to prosecute those who enter illegally. That, sources say, could create a bottleneck.

       (AP) â€œIt would be a group of five or seven that all had the same answers and nobody was related,â€ said San Diego Border Patrol Agent Eduardo Oleos. â€œThat tells me that theyâ€™re coached.â€ Immigration lawyers and the smuggling groups who control the border often tell the immigrants what to say in their initial â€œcredible fearâ€ interview. Pass it, and most will get to stay in the U.S. indefinitely, regardless of an immigration judgeâ€™s findings. â€œWe know that someone coached them or weâ€™ve even found the slips of paper with the actual answers on them or a certain statement to say identifying their credible fear,â€ said National Border Patrol Council Local 1613 President Terence Shigg.Â â€œWeâ€™ve had times where people have gotten over here and itâ€™s worked.

21/06/2018,2018,6,21,Associated Press,"'Great job,' says Trump: Nielsen back in good graces for now","WASHINGTON â€“  Kirstjen Nielsen has one hard-earned presidential signing pen. President Donald Trump used the black marker Wednesday to sign an executive order halting family separations at the U.S. border â€” then handed it to Nielsen, his Homeland Security secretary. Such pens are typically framed and displayed in lobbies and office waiting areas all over Washington as trophies of presidential proximity and power. Nielsen&aposs was tougher to come by than most. By the time Trump used it to reverse his policy, Nielsen had been both yelled at and praised by Trump and pilloried for repeating his falsehoods. She was forced to deny that the policy amounted to child abuse. On Tuesday night, she cut short a working dinner at a Mexican restaurant after protesters shouted, ""Shame!"" until, finally, she left. Yet there she stood Wednesday in the Oval Office, right at Trump&aposs side, as he reversed the policy she had defended â€” and had vowed the administration would not apologize for. With Vice President Mike Pence at Trump&aposs opposite shoulder, the president invited Nielsen to speak. She thanked him for his leadership. ""Great job,"" Trump said over his shoulder to her. He signed the order and handed Nielsen the pen. With that, Nielsen was apparently back in the president&aposs good graces. But fairly or not, the Georgetown and University of Virginia-educated lawyer will probably always be the face of a policy that ignited nearly ubiquitous outrage. According to people close to the secretary, family separations weren&apost her idea. One person who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Nielsen had been ""working nonstop"" to find a solution. The polarizing path Nielsen has taken is somewhat surprising for a government bureaucrat and policy wonk known more for her loyalty to White House chief of staff John Kelly and her expertise in cybersecurity than for the hard-line immigration views espoused by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House adviser Stephen Miller. Nielsen, 46, was considered an expert in both homeland and national security policy who worked in President George W. Bush&aposs administration and had a role in its handling of Hurricane Katrina. Two years after the 2005 hurricane, Congress issued reports that faulted the White House Homeland Security Council â€” where Nielsen directed preparedness and response â€” for failing to take the lead in staying on top of the unfolding disaster. Following Trump&aposs election, Nielsen joined the transition team to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process to become Trump&aposs secretary of Homeland Security. Nielsen quickly won the retired general&aposs trust, impressing him with her work ethic and command of the issues. Trump eventually tapped Nielsen to take over as head of DHS, and the Senate confirmed her Dec. 5. By April, Sessions announced there would be ""zero tolerance"" at the border for people crossing illegally. That meant that anyone who did not arrive at a designated port of entry and claimed asylum would be arrested. As public backlash grew, Nielsen misled the public by denying that separating families was part of U.S. policy. While the policy never specifically called for children to be taken from parents, separation became inevitable. That&aposs because adults were detained and charged â€” and any children traveling with them couldn&apost go to jail. Nielsen, like Trump, also suggested that it was up to Congress to fix the problem â€” even though the enforcement of laws happens at the president&aposs discretion. The Bush and Obama administrations largely allowed families to stay together. While her allies say she was merely following the law, it is likely there was another reason Nielsen tirelessly defended the policy: She has a track record of working to make her bosses happy. Also, her history with Trump was bumpy. Earlier this spring, Trump had unloaded on Nielsen during a Cabinet meeting over an increase in border apprehensions and legal setbacks, according to people familiar with the exchange but not authorized to speak publicly. Nielsen, one person said, tried to explain that the issues were complex and that the department&aposs powers were limited by legal restrictions. She told the president her team was doing everything it could, but the president was left unconvinced. After news of the dressing-down spread, Nielsen did not deny the meeting had grown heated and issued a statement saying, ""I share his frustration."" ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___ Follow Kellman and Flaherty at http://www.twitter.com/@APLaurieKellman and http://www.twitter.com/@AnneKFlaherty",https://www.foxnews.com/us/great-job-says-trump-nielsen-back-in-good-graces-for-now,MILITARY,Fox News,

          Reaction to President Trumpâ€™s executive order proves he cannot win when it comes to the mainstream media.

Developing now, Thursday, June 21,Â 2018 - The first day of summer TwoÂ Trump-backed immigration bills may go up for a House vote Thursday, one day after the president ended separations of illegal immigrant families at the border, but passage of either bill seemed doubtful Trump vows his immigrationÂ policy will continue to be 'as tough as it's been' after signing hisÂ executive order to keep illegal immigrant families together. But Democrats say the measure allows for indefinite detentions The Trump administration will propose merging the Labor Department with the Education Department, a report says Actor Peter Fonda apologizes for vulgar remarks about President Trump's 12-year-old son, Barron.

It would also provide a pathway to citizenship for nearly 1.8 million so-called ""Dreamers,"" illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age. The other bill up for a vote Thursday, put together by House Judiciary Chair Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., takes a more conservative approach. It would afford the nearly 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients only a temporarily protected legal status that could be indefinitely renewed, rather than a full pathway to citizenship.

TRUMP VOWS TO STAY â€˜TOUGHâ€™: Speaking to cheering supporters in Duluth, Minn.,Â  President Trump promised his immigration policies would remain ""as tough"" as they have been  after he  signed an executive order pledging that children would no longer be separated Â fromÂ their illegal immigrant families at the border. However, s ome Democrats, eyeing the November midterms,Â said Trump&aposs executive order was not enough andÂ detains illegal immigrants ""indefinitely""  ...Â The order Trump signed allows children to stay in detention with their parents for an extended period of time. It does not, however, end the ""zero-tolerance"" policy that criminally prosecutes adults entering the country without proper documentation. Trump&aposs order came after he and other officials repeatedly said only Congress had the power to stop children and their parents from being separated.Â Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted Wednesday night that the executive order ""merely replaces one inhumane act with another."" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, shared similar sentiments, tweeting: ""Itâ€™s extremely troubling that the presidentâ€™s executive order would require immigrant families with children to be detained indefinitely.""

In the 1990s, Republican lawmakers proposed merging the Education and Labor departments with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The new agency would have been dubbed the Department of Education and Employment, but such plans never got off the ground. FONDA GETS OFF â€˜EASYâ€™:  Actor Peter Fonda, best known for â€œEasy Riderâ€ nearly 50 years ago, has issued an apology for his â€œinappropriate and vulgarâ€ tweet about the presidentâ€™s son, Barron Trump , in which he called for him to be â€œrippedâ€ from his mother and put in a â€œcage with pedophiles"" ...Â  After some  since-deleted tweets the 78-year-old Oscar-winner made about the Trumps administrationâ€™s policy of separating children from their families  at the southern border gained negative attention and were flagged by the Secret Service, heâ€™s issued an apology. â€œI went way too far,"" he wrote in a statement provided to FOXÂ News. ""It was wrong and I should not have done it.â€ However, perhaps most stunning aspect of Fonda&aposs ugly attack was silence of Democratic leaders and Hollywood&aposs liberal elite. Neither Sen.

           (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) President Trump isn&apost known for his sweet talk -- but his sweet toss is now world-famous. Amid tensions at the G-7 summit earlier this month, Trump reportedly tossed Starburst candies in front of embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel and quipped: â€œHere Angela, donâ€™t say I never give you anything.â€ The â€œunexplainably juicyâ€ moment at the otherwise sour meeting of world leaders in Canada was revealed by Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer, who said the incident came during a huddle at the end of the summit when Trump was being pressed to sign a joint statement. â€œTrump was sitting there with his arms crossed, clearly not liking the fact that they were ganging up on him,â€ Bremmer told CBS News. â€œHe eventually agreed and said okay, heâ€™ll sign it. And at that point, he stood up, he put his hand in his pocket, his suit jacket pocket, and he took two Starburst candies out, threw them on the table and said to Merkel, â€˜Here, Angela, donâ€™t say I never give you anything.â€™â€ That huddle became an online sensation after a photo emerged of an exasperated Merkel facing down a sitting Trump. The president has pushed back on the claim that it was a sign of disagreement -- and has released other pictures that show a more relaxed atmosphere. â€œI have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for!â€ he tweeted. Yet, Trump has had a turbulent relationship with the German chancellor -- whom in 2015 he accused of â€œruining Germanyâ€ -- particularly on the subject of immigration. On Monday, days after claiming they had a great relationship, he said that Germans are â€œturning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.â€ Trump appeared to be referring to Merkelâ€™s struggle to keep her coalition in tact after Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has pledged to implement a tough migration policy in which asylum seekers registered in other countries could be turned away at the border. Merkel has disagreed with the policy, fearing that it could fracture the E.U., but Seehofer has threatened to carry it out anyway. Video Merkel will travel to Brussels later this month to talk with E.U. partners about a common European solution and Seehofer has delayed enforcing the policy until then. But if there is no solution by July, it risks breaking up Merkelâ€™s coalition and sparking new elections, where the rise in popularity of the right-wing Alternative for Germany could spell trouble for Merkelâ€™s Christian Democrats.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-reportedly-tossed-starburst-at-merkel-during-g-7-summit-dont-say-i-never-give-you-anything,Alliances,Fox News,
01/07/2018,2018,7,1,Dan Gainor,"Left-wing media panic over Supreme Court turning right, as some link Trump to newspaper shooting","
          FILE - In this April 10, 2017 photo, President Donald Trump, left, and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy participate in a public swearing-in ceremony for Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Rose Garden of the White House White House in Washington. The 81-year-old Kennedy said Tuesday, June 27, 2018, that he is retiring after more than 30 years on the court.
           (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Media furor was aroused last week by four major Supreme Court cases that went against the left and by a  Supreme Court retirement  that will enable President Trump to appoint a solidly conservative justice to the high court. That was followed by a horrific mass shooting at a Maryland newspaper that some journalists tried to link to criticism the president has leveled at the media. The Supreme Court dominated much of the week. Each successive ruling seemed to infuriate journalists and liberals more. But Justice Anthony Kennedyâ€™s announcement of his retirement was the last straw. ABCâ€™s â€œGood Morning Americaâ€  Correspondent Terry Moran  set the ominous tone, saying that Â Kennedyâ€™s retirement â€œguarantees that this court and this country is going to change profoundly.â€ Others  called the nomination of a new justice an â€œearthquakeâ€ or an incident that would evolve into â€œa months-long bare-knuckle fight over this nominee.â€ CNNâ€™s legal team acted as if the Constitution itself was at risk because the high court is now expected to move farther right. Topics like abortion and religious freedom dominated the coverage. CNN Legal Analyst Laura Coates said the retirement of Kennedy means even more. There are â€œa whole host of areas where we require a swing vote for other more progressive-minded notions and ones that, frankly, are in line with our democratic principles and we don&apost have that now,â€  she warned. Conservatives arenâ€™t allowed to have â€œdemocratic principles,â€ it seems. CNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin was particularly  overwrought . He warned gay customers who patronize businesses owned by religious conservatives that â€œyou will not be able to buy a hotel room, be served in a restaurant, buy a wedding cake.â€ Many other outlets were nearly as hyperbolic: The Daily Beast warned of a â€œjudicial apocalypse.â€ Slateâ€™s Dan Kois wrote about his own â€œfrothing, incoherent rage.â€ Seldom funny â€œDaily Showâ€ host  Trevor Noah  complained that President Trump was â€œgiving America judicial herpes.â€ Coverage continued to spin out of control once the media started asking about next steps. MSNBCâ€™s â€œHardballâ€ host Chris Matthews argued that the fight over  Kennedyâ€™s replacement  was â€œgoing to be almost like Spanish Civil War stuff.â€ Itâ€™s worth noting that hundreds of thousands of people died in that civil war. Matthews warned  Democratic leaders  that they must â€œprevent the Republican-controlled Senate to pick another justice on this hard-right court.â€ Slate was more  straightforward . It reported that a more conservative Supreme Court would be one â€œthat subverts American democracy for decades.â€ Journalists are unable to grasp how the prospect of a more conservative court actually makes tens of millions of Americans positively giddy. That narrative was almost impossible to find. 2. Journalists Defend Abortion, Again:  Abortion is one of the most sacred â€œrightsâ€ for the media. This becomes obvious any time defunding Planned Parenthood becomes a key news topic. That factored heavily into coverage of the Supreme Court vacancy. â€œCBS This Morningâ€ host and resident  Democratic donor  Gayle King couldnâ€™t help herself and  asked conservative Leonard Leo,  of the Federalist Society: â€œBut should we be worried about Roe v. Wade going away?â€ We. CNNâ€™s Toobin continued his panic, predicting that abortion will be banned in 10 to 20 states in less than two years once President Trump appoints another conservative to the Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade, he warned, is â€œdoomed and abortion will be illegal in a significant chunk of this country in 18 months.â€ Hollywood embraced the  Toobin narrative.  Cher tweeted breathlessly: â€œSome Americans could find themselves in internment camps!!â€ Actor  Don Cheadle  claimed that â€œall of our rights are in the balance.â€ Actress  Bette Midler  cited a famous  anti-fascist book  in her tweet: â€œAnd you thought it couldnâ€™t happen here.â€ â€œThe Viewâ€ outdid itself in kooky commentary.  Host Whoopi Goldberg  went on a lengthy rant that ended with: â€œGet out of my behind! Get out of my vagina! Get out!â€ Her co-host Joy Behar whined that the GOP might end up controlling all three branches of government. â€œWhat is that called? Dictatorship I believe!â€ 3. Blaming Trump:  The shooting deaths of five employees at the Capital Gazette newspaper near Annapolis, Maryland drove some in the media to blame President Trump. A Massachusetts reporter  resigned  after making a false claim that the shooter had dropped a â€œMake America Great Againâ€ hat during the attack.  Reuters Breakingviews Editor Rob Cox  apologized for tying President Trump to the incident, after it was discovered the shooter had a longstanding fight with the paper.

Socialism Will Work This Time, They Promise:  The media were agog over the Democratic primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old member of the  Democratic Socialists of America  for a congressional seat representing part of New York City. The New York Times dubbed her  â€œan instant political rock star,â€  helped in huge part that sheâ€™s in the Big Apple and only slightly to the left of the staff at The Times. Her campaign platform has more giveaways than a TV game show and so-called neutral journalists absolutely adore her. Reporters didnâ€™t focus on how socialist nations take away rights and murder their citizens. They didnâ€™t even inquire about her stance on Venezuela, where things are so bad that citizens broke into the zoo â€¦  to cook up the animals. No, journalists focused on her lipstick. I almost hate myself for even writing that word. Lipstick. The first one of these discredited, unprofessional stories came from People magazine. It was  headlined : â€œCongressional Primary Victor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Reveals Her Power Red Lipstick Shade.â€ Racked called the lipstick,  â€œa symbol of change.â€  Refinery29 said it was  â€œMore Than Just A Color.â€  Jezebel raved about how â€œ Her Lipstick Remained Intact.â€  Allure, Quartz and others all gave her some lip. Then CBS broke the big  news : â€œAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez name-dropped her lipstick brand and it sold out.â€ Ocasio-Cortez&aposs lipstick is like Wendy Davisâ€™s tennis shoes. Itâ€™s designed to make her appear like an everywoman, despite her far-left politics. This is socialism with a Madison Avenue marketing campaign. Of course, the other aspect of Ocasio-Cortez&aposs surprising victory was how badly The New York Times missed it â€“ right in its own backyard. Former Times executive editor Jill Abramson accused her old paper of â€œmaking horrible mistakes left and right.â€ (Mostly left, but thatâ€™s for another time.) Abramson did call out the paper and say â€œit should have covered her campaign,â€ instead of being surprised she had won.

          Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
           (AP) The White House has expanded its shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees beyond the 25 candidates that have been publicly disclosed, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday. President Trump has announced that he will name a candidate to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy on July 9. ""The White House counsel told me there have been a few additional, potential nominees added to that list,"" Collins told ABC&aposs ""This Week."" Collins, a moderate Republican widely seen as a key vote in the upcoming Supreme Court nomination hearing, said she had already ruled out some of the candidates on the list that the White House released in November. â€œSome people on the list I canâ€™t support because they have shown disrespect for vital principle of stare decisis,â€ Collins said, referring to the judicial principle that affords strong deference to previous court rulings. OPINION: REPLACING KENNEDY WILL TRIGGER ALL-OUT WARFARE The phrase is often invoked in the context of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case establishing a constitutional basis for abortion rights that Democrats have warned may now be in jeopardy. ""A candidate for this important position who would overturnÂ Roe v. WadeÂ would not be acceptable to me because that would indicate an activist agenda that I don&apost want to see a judge have,"" Collins said. Collins did not elaborate on specific judges she had ruled out. The Los Angeles Times  recently claimed, inaccurately,  that one top candidate on Trump&aposs list, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, wrote in a 2003 academic publication that Roe v. Wade was ""erroneous."" Barrett, the former Notre Dame law professor who Trump recently appointed to the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit, has often spoken about her Catholic faith. During her confirmation hearings last year, Senate Democrats were widely criticized for grilling Barrett on her Catholic faith, despite her insistence that she would not ""impose"" her personal convictions on the law. WATCH: DEMS TAKE HEAT AFTER GRILLING NOMINEE FOR CATHOLIC FAITH Justice Kennedy largely voted with the Supreme Court&aposs liberal bloc on abortion rights, even as he sided with conservatives on other key issues. President Trump said on Fox News on Sunday that he expects his next Supreme Court pick â€œto go very quickly."" The president added that he&aposs unlikely to ask his nomineeâ€™s position on the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion rights case -- which Collins said the president had also told her, as well. â€œThe president told me in our meeting that he would not ask that question,â€ Collins said in a separate interview on CNN. Trump said abortion rights ""could very well end up"" being determined on a state-by-state basis after a new Supreme Court justice is seated, but the president said heÂ ""probably"" would not ask his pick to replace Kennedy how they would vote on Roe v. Wade. â€œBut Iâ€™m putting conservative people on,â€ Trump said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-has-expanded-supreme-court-shortlist-amid-pressure-from-pro-choice-advocates-gop-senator-claims,Supreme Court,Fox News,

          National security adviser John Bolton spoke exclusively Sunday to Fox News about the president's upcoming Russia summit.
           (AP) In his first interview since meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week, National Security Adviser John Bolton told ""Fox News Sunday"" that critics are wrong to suggest President Trump has been too soft on Russia. President Trumpâ€™s upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin will take place in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, the  White House announced  last week. ""I don&apost think anybody ought to have a case of the vapors"" about President Trump&aposs rhetoric on NATO and Russia, Bolton said. ""The main rationale to have a bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin: let them discuss these issues and see exactly where there might be room for progress, or where they might find there&aposs no room at all,"" he added. The meeting would allow the leaders to cut through ""political noise"" about alleged Russian collusion, Bolton said.

07/07/2018,2018,7,7,Associated Press,Trump lawyers assailed Comey as 'Machiavellian' in 2017 memo to Mueller,"close Video Has the IG report poisoned Mueller's investigation? Clinton email probe reveals pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking FBI officials. Lawyers for President Trump unleashed a blistering attack on ex-FBI Director James Comey in a confidential memo last year to the special counsel in the Russian election meddling probe, casting him as ""Machiavellian,"" dishonest and ""unbounded by law and regulation"" as they sought to undermine the credibility of a law enforcement leader they see as a critical witness against the president. The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, provides a window into the formation of a legal strategy being used by Trump&aposs lawyers as they seek to pit the president&aposs word against that of the former FBI director. Comey&aposs firing in May 2017 helped set in motion the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and one-on-one conversations with Trump that Comey documented in a series of memos helped form the basis of Mueller&aposs inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice. Mueller is looking broadly into Russia&aposs meddling in the U.S. election and its contacts with people in Trump&aposs campaign. The June 27, 2017, letter was written by Marc Kasowitz, then the president&aposs lead lawyer, as Mueller and his team were in the early stages of their investigation into Trump associates and as they had begun examining whether the president, by firing Comey, had sought to stymie an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign&aposs ties to Russia. The White House initially pointed as justification for the firing to a Justice Department memo that faulted Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, though Trump later said that ""this Russia thing"" was on his mind when he made the move. The document also could have new relevance in the aftermath of a Justice Department inspector general report that criticized Comey for departing from established protocol in the Clinton investigation. It&aposs not clear to what extent, if any, the attacks on Comey have resonated with Mueller&aposs team, which continues to seek an interview with the president on whether he had a corrupt intent when he fired the FBI director. And even in the face of withering criticism, Comey has been largely consistent in his telling of his interactions with Trump in his memos, his book and numerous press interviews he&aposs given in recent months. 
      Comey has been under heavy criticism from Trump and his team
       (Fox News) The 13-page document aims to identify for Mueller what the lawyers believe are grievous errors both in how Comey handled the Clinton investigation and in his early, and limited, encounters with the president. In it, Kasowitz argues that Comey cannot be trusted as a witness because he repeatedly embellished his testimony before Congress, put his ""own personal interests and emotions"" above FBI protocol and left a cloud of undue suspicion above the president&aposs head. ""Over the last year, Mr. Comey has engaged in a pattern of calculated unilateral action unbounded by governing law, regulation and practice, and plainly motivated by personal and political self-interest,"" wrote Kasowitz, who has since stepped aside as lead lawyer. Lawyers for Comey declined to comment Saturday. Kasowitz and Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow did not immediately return messages, and former Trump attorney John Dowd declined to comment. Peter Carr, spokesman for Mueller, also declined comment Saturday. The document does not focus on questions of Trump&aposs guilt or innocence. Instead, it casts in a negative light actions that Comey has said he carefully reasoned and that he has vigorously defended in his book and interviews. Those include the decision to announce on his own without Justice Department consultation the conclusion of the Clinton investigation, and the decision months later to brief Trump -- then the president-elect -- on allegations about him in a salacious dossier. ""Mr. Comey continued his Machiavellian behavior after President Trump was elected,"" Kasowitz wrote. Among the principal lines of attack are Comey&aposs acknowledgment that he provided his lawyers with contemporaneous memos about his interactions with Trump and authorized one of them to share details with the news media. In one such encounter, Comey said the president asked him at a private dinner for his loyalty and that Comey offered him ""honest loyalty"" instead. ""There is no `honest loyalty&apos in an FBI Director surreptitiously leaking to civilians his privileged and confidential conversations with the president, or misappropriating and disseminating his confidential FBI memos or their contents about those meetings,"" Kasowitz wrote. ""There is no `honest loyalty&apos in using those civilians as surrogates to feed stolen information and memos to the press to achieve a personal, political, and retributive objective of harming a sitting president."" Like Trump, the lawyer also complains about Comey&aposs refusal to state publicly to Congress that the president was not under investigation even though he said so privately. ""Despite his repeated assurances to the President over the prior three months that he was not under investigation, the President&aposs repeated pleas to make that fact public, and Mr. Comey&aposs testimony that he had DOJ (Department of Justice) approval to make this `extraordinary&apos announcement, Mr. Comey not only declined to clarify that there was no investigation of the President, but he used broad language that only reinforced the inaccurate perception that the President was under investigation,"" Kasowitz wrote.  Â Â   The New York Times earlier reported that Kasowitz had written two letters to Mueller in June 2017 and published one in which he categorically rejected the idea that Comey&aposs firing could constitute obstruction of justice. The AP obtained a copy of the other document, in addition to a two-page memo from September in which Trump lawyers lament to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller was ""inexplicably"" not investigating Comey&aposs ""misconduct"" they had earlier raised. Kasowitz says Comey stonewalled the president&aposs request to clear his name in order to ""sustain an investigative cloud"" over his head that would make it hard for Trump to fire him. Comey, for his part, has said he had already told congressional leaders who was and was not under investigation, and that he was reluctant to make public statements in case something changed and he needed to correct the record. The letter castigates Comey for usurping the authority of his Justice Department bosses by announcing the conclusion of the Clinton investigation without seeking their approval, a criticism echoed by the inspector general last month. Comey has said he made the announcement alone because of concern that Justice Department leadership was seen as politically compromised. The letter says Comey ""confronted"" the president-elect in a January 2017 Trump Tower meeting ""with phony but highly embarrassing allegations concerning his personal life"" from a dossier compiled by a former British spy. It was the first in a series of conversations that Comey documented in writing, something Trump lawyers say he did with the ultimate goal of harming the president. Comey has said he told Trump about the dossier allegations because they were widely known in Washington, including by the media, and that he kept his memos because he was concerned that Trump might lie about their conversations. In the September memo obtained by AP, Dowd, who left the legal team in March, expressed dismay to Rosenstein that there was no grand jury investigation into ""the obviously corrupt conclusion"" of the Clinton investigation, suggesting it was improper that Comey had begun drafting a statement closing the probe even before Clinton was interviewed. ""Today, you are faced with a terrible blight on our Department of Justice which must be addressed to restore and inspire confidence in the Department,"" Dowd said in calling for the grand jury investigation.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lawyers-assailed-comey-as-machiavellian-in-2017-memo-to-mueller,White House,Fox News,

           (Associated Press) European leaders are reportedly nervous that President Donald Trump will make good on his campaign promise to withdraw American troops from the continent if host countries fail to pay their fair share for defense. Trump has long complained that the U.S. bears too large a financial burden, but has yet to act. While the issue is not expected to come up at the Brussels meeting of NATO next week, uncertainty abounds.  Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told  McClatchy  that European leaders are â€œscared to deathâ€ and are â€œincreasingly worried [Trump] is going to do things not based on whatâ€™s in the best interest â€¦ but based solely on his vision of â€˜America First.â€™â€  
      After Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO allies agreed to move toward a goal of devoting 2 percent of GDP to defense within a decade.
       (Associated Press) Last month, a G-7 meeting in Canada turned sour when Trump disparaged allies and refused to sign a joint statement. Trumpâ€™s upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, has exacerbated concerns as well. Erik Brattberg of the Carnegie Endowmentâ€™s Europe program, worried that criticizing Europeans weakens alliances and provides â€œnew opportunities for countries like Russia to take advantage of that.â€  Eastern Europe, which sits at Russiaâ€™s doorstep, has been particularly eager to keep American troops. Poland, for instance, has put forth a  proposal  for the U.S. to building permanent military bases. According to  Pew Research Data , more than 60,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed in Europe, including 35,000 in Germany, 12,000 in Italy, 8,500 in Britain, and 3,300 in Spain, with thousands more rotating into other European countries per circumstance. But despite Trumpâ€™s rhetoric, his administration has maintained tactical support for Europe, having sent military equipment, participated in regional exercises, and signed defense agreements with Finland and Sweden. Still, any move to permanently withdraw American troops from Europe would ultimately require congressional authorization.

Clinton email probe reveals pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking FBI officials. President Trumpâ€™s lawyers have told FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller that they want him to produce evidence that Trump has committed a crime before they agree for the president to be interviewed as part of Muellerâ€™s Russia investigation. Rudy Giuliani, the top lawyer on the legal team, told Fox News on Saturday he is asking Mueller for a â€œfactual basis for the investigationâ€ before the team considers allowing Trump to be interviewed by Muellerâ€™s team. Trump and his team have become increasingly frustrated with how long Muellerâ€™s probe is taking to complete, and Trump in particular has taken a more aggressive stance toward Mueller since the Department of Justice criticized the FBIâ€™s actions in 2016 in relation to the Hillary Clinton email probe. The new demands by Trumpâ€™s legal team indicate that it is likely to take a more aggressive and combative stance toward Mueller going forward. The New York Times , which first reported on the new demands, reported that Giuliani has acknowledged that Mueller is unlikely to agree to them, and also left open the possibility that Trump may still agree to be interviewed. Trump has repeatedly said he is keen to sit down with Mueller. Video The presidentâ€™s lawyers specifically want Mueller to explain how the Justice Department gave him the authority to investigation possible obstruction of justice in what was initially a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to the Times. They also want him to show that that the special counsel has exhausted every other investigative measure before requesting an interview with the president. The new stance from Trumpâ€™s legal team comes amid a more aggressive stance by Trump. He has repeatedly called the Russia probe a â€œwitch huntâ€ and has taken to calling the Mueller team â€œthe 13 Angry Democrats.â€ Last month he called out Mueller for having alleged conflicts of interest. â€œWhen is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report,â€ he tweeted. ""And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked [Hillary Clinton]? How many people will be sent to jail and persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion).â€ Trump has also sought to link Mueller with former FBI Director James Comey, saying that they are â€œbest friends.â€ Trumpâ€™s challenging of the objectivity of the Mueller probe is also being echoed by his legal team, possibly as a way of undermining the probe in the eyes of the public.Â  â€œIf they can come to us and show us the basis and that itâ€™s legitimate and that they have uncovered something, we can go from there and assess their objectivity,â€ Giuliani told the Times. Trump and his team have repeatedly pointed to FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from the Mueller team after anti-Trump texts he sent to an FBI colleague were uncovered, as a sign of bias within the agency and Mueller&aposs team. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz has said he is investigating whether Strzok&aposs bias may have influenced the launch of the Russia probe. Giuliani has suggested the probe is â€œso taintedâ€ by bias that it may need to be thrown out â€œIf in fact, this is infected with a bias of major proportions from the beginning by Strzok and it seems like it is, and he left behind some of his cohorts...if thatâ€™s the case then how can you trust anything theyâ€™re doing in this investigation?â€ he said on ""America&aposs Newsroom."" IG CONFIRMS HE IS REVIEWING WHETHER STRZOK&aposS ANTI-TRUMP BIAS IMPACTED LAUNCH OF RUSSIA PROBEÂ  Trumpâ€™s legal team has also challenged a Mueller request to interview White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to the Times, and has tried to narrow the questions as well as find out what he wants to ask. Kelly has not yet been questioned. Pressure on Mueller to end the probe has also come from Congress, where Republican lawmakers have also criticized the probe. â€œWhatever you got, finish it the hell up, because this country is being torn apart,â€ Rep.

Former clerk for Justice Kennedy provides insight. Almost immediately after news broke June 27 that Justice Anthony Kennedy was retiring from the Supreme Court, liberals and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine (but I repeat myself) began warning President Trump not to nominate an â€œactivist judgeâ€ who would overturn â€œprecedent.â€Â  Translation: Mr. President, donâ€™t you dare send us a nominee who would overturn Roe v. Wade! The 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide has been a hot-button issue ever since it was handed down, with the Right to Life movement working to overturn it. The liberals rightfully recognize that Roe v. Wade might be overturned by a more conservative Supreme Court faithful to the original meaning of the Constitution and the intent of its framers. The simple fact is that the Supreme Court created a constitutional right to abortion out of whole cloth 45 years ago with the Roe v. Wade decision. The founders didnâ€™t contemplate or intend the courts to be policymakers and legislate from the bench â€“ a favorite tactic of the left. The Constitution says absolutely nothing about abortion â€“ and the framers never even considered making it a constitutional right to abort unborn babies at nearly any point in a pregnancy. Instead, the supposedÂ right to abortionsÂ sprang from the imaginations of liberal activists who invented nonexistent constitutional rights to advance their ideological agenda. So progressives are right to be afraid that whoever President Trump appoints to the Supreme Court will join other conservatives in repealing Roe â€“ a flawed decision that should never have been made in the first place. Like millions of other Americans, I believe that protecting the lives of millions of unborn children is our moral duty. The media might ignore our view, or try to portray us as opponents of womenâ€™s rights, but hundreds of thousands of AmericansÂ  have marched on Washington Â every year since Roe v. Wade was handed down, calling for an end to the abortion-on-demand industry in America. And no matter how you slice the polls, a consistent majority of Americans believe abortion should at least beÂ  restricted . Now Democrats lament overturning precedent in their frantic efforts to keep the abortion industry in business â€“ unless that precedent is at the state level, where Democrats canâ€™t get the votes to overturn the populationâ€™s views. This obsession with preserving precedent puts Democrats in the position of placing value on upholding past decisions whether they are good or bad. But when something is rotten to the core, you have to tear it out at the roots. Allowing weeds to overrun your garden just because they have â€œa long tradition of existenceâ€ is no justification at all. In fact, it is absurd and senseless. Tearing out weeds in the garden of Supreme Court decisions is not judicial activism, because it is not judicial activism to uphold constitutionalism. And there is precedent for overturning Supreme Court precedents.Â The Supreme Court has erred in the past by dehumanizing African-Americans in decisions like Dred Scott v. Sanford, and Plessy v. Ferguson that justified the moral injustices of slavery and racial segregation. It erred in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision in dehumanizing unborn children and justifying aborting them. So Supreme Court precedent is not sacrosanct. Justices on the nationâ€™s highest court are fallible human beings and they can make â€“ and have made â€“ mistakes. No one should pretend that Roe v. Wade was handed down to us on stone tablets from God. On a broader level, many on the left are finally realizing that the Supreme Court â€“ one of their favorite tools to force their political beliefs on the rest of the country â€“ could be out of their control for decades after the appointment of a new conservative justice. Thanks to the decision by retired Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to allow lower court judges and executive branch employees to win Senate confirmation by a simple majority â€“ rather than a two-thirds majority â€“ the next Supreme Court nominee will need only 51 Senate votes to be confirmed, rather than a two-thirds majority of 67 in the 100-member Senate. Republicans followed Reidâ€™s lead and extended his jettisoning of the two-third nominating requirement to the Supreme Court. Because Republicans â€“ who hold 51 seats in the Senateâ€” need only 51 votes to confirm the next justice, you might think theyâ€™d have no problem confirming whoever President Trump nominates. However, Republican Sen. John McCain â€“ being treated for brain cancer in his home state of Arizona â€“ is not expected to be well enough to come to Washington to vote. And Sen. Collins has indicated she will oppose any nominee who she thinks will overturn Roe v. Wade. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, might also vote against a nominee she thinks would overturn Roe. All this means the outcome of a confirmation vote is uncertain. Republicans are hoping to pick up a small number of Democratic votes to close the gap, with the expected Democratic votes coming from the 10 red state incumbent Democratic senators up for re-election in November. Most Republicans want to put the Supreme Court out of reach of the left for a generation or more. In fact, the fight for the Supreme Court is why many evangelicals and Catholics broke late for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race. He rewarded them with the appointment of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. It appears the president will again reward his base with another relatively young Federalist Society judge who will show a fidelity to the Founding Fathersâ€™ view of the Constitution â€“ a terrifying thought to the left. Thatâ€™s because the founders didnâ€™t contemplate or intend the courts to be policymakers and legislate from the bench â€“ a favorite tactic of the left. So as our friends on the left yet again wade through the various stages of grief â€“ they so wish a President Hillary Clinton would be appointing Supreme Court justices to their liking â€“ I would tell them: terrible Supreme Court decisions make for terrible precedent. Just as the Supreme Court overturned the Dred Scott and Plessy decisions, the high court should overturn Roe v. Wade. Activist liberal justices should not impose their personal pro-abortion views â€“ which have no basis in the Constitution â€“ on our nation via judicial fiat.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/activist-judges-suddenly-a-bad-thing-as-democrats-await-trump-supreme-court-pick,OPINION,Fox News,

London Mayor Sadiq Khan slammed President Trumpâ€™s criticism of him as â€œpreposterousâ€ after allowing a giant Trump balloon at anti-Trump protests in London, but critics question whether the mayor should be devoting his energy to tackling crime rather than â€œembarrassingâ€ the city in front of the whole world. Trump reignited the feud with Khan in an interview with  The Sun  newspaper, saying the Mayor of London â€œhas done a terrible jobâ€ when it comes to terrorism and crime. â€œI think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in,â€ he said. Khan called the comments â€œpreposterousâ€ on the BBCâ€™s Today program on Friday, claiming that violent crime has risen across the country and London has been forced to tackle the issue with a smaller police budget.

       (Reuters) But crime in London persists on epidemic proportions as murder rate soared by 44 percent, with 157 homicides committed compared to 109 the previous year, according to official statistics from  the Metropolitan Police . A former ambassador to the U.S., Sir Christopher Meyer, was the victim of a violent attack against him at a central London underground station this week. â€œIâ€™m absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality,â€ his wife, Baroness Meyer,  told  the Times of London. â€œThey really beat him. Itâ€™s appalling â€” like something you would see in a war zone. Earlier this year, for the first time in modern history, London overtook New York in the number of murders. In February, Londonâ€™s police investigated 15 murders while New York saw 11 homicides. In March, the Metropolitan Police murder numbers increased further to 22, while NYPDâ€™s jumped to 21. The City of New York  has since  taken back the lead however. London is also facing the rise of shocking acid attacks,Â skyrocketing by more than 78 per cent over the past two years, with 465 such offenses in 2017, up from 260 in 2015, according to police figures  obtained  by the Evening Standard. 
      Businessman and the Apprentice winner Mark Wright has called out London Mayor Sadiq Khan for feuding with President Donald Trump while the city's crime problem continues to grow.
       (Twitter) This led to frustrated Londoners airing their concerns about the spiraling crime in the city, all while Khan remains preoccupied with feuding with Trump. â€œThis guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues. I just think heâ€™s so worried about himself, his reputation and PR rather than portraying the country, the city in the best way can be and making it safe for the citizens,â€ London business leader Mark Wright, who won the UK&aposs version of The Apprentice, told Fox News. â€œI think he embarrassed himself, heâ€™s embarrassed Britain because no matter what you think of Donald Trump, itâ€™s irrelevant. America is the most powerful country in the world, the office of president has got to be respected no matter who that person is and that wasnâ€™t done and I was very disappointed,â€ he added. ""This guy spends his week getting a balloon of Donald Trump in a nappy put in the air in central London instead of helping us with severe issues."" â€” Businessman and the Apprentice winner Mark Wright Wrightâ€™s comments echo recent remarks by former New York mayor, now attorney for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, under whose tenure the cityâ€™s crime rate dropped by more than half and murders decreased by two thirds thanks to tough zero-tolerance policing â€“ a measure Khan once vehemently opposed yet was forced to reintroduce amid the crime epidemic. â€œSadiq Khan should be ashamed of himself. Heâ€™s so busy attacking President Trumpâ€™s visit and, in the meantime, crime is spiraling in London. Maybe he should just do his job instead of attacking a world leader,â€ Giuliani  told  Britainâ€™s Sunday Express. He added: â€œI would not like to go to a country where someone with the authority of a mayor was rallying people against them. Itâ€™s highly inappropriate. Heâ€™s probably suffering from some of the criticisms that President Trump has made of him, which are valid.â€ 
      Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Sadiq Khan should be ashamed of himself for attacking President Trump as the city faces crime problems.
       (AP) Since the beginning of the year over 50 people were fatally stabbed in the streets of the capital of Britain. Just this Thursday, a 17-year-old girl was fatally stabbed in London. Nearly 1,300 stabbings occurred in London up to the end of April. Stabbings in London are at their highest level in six years, with around 21 percent rise from the previous year. â€œIâ€™m a bit ashamed to be living in Britain today with how Sadiq Khan has led the city carry on with Trump here. Heâ€™s the worst mayor we had in history in London. Itâ€™s easier now to get a knife or a deadly weapon than itâ€™s to get Starbucks. You can get a knife anywhere here at the moment,â€ Wright said. â€œHeâ€™s in no position to be throwing rocks in glass houses,â€ the businessman added. ""Itâ€™s easier now to get a knife or a deadly weapon than itâ€™s to get Starbucks. You can get a knife anywhere here at the moment."" â€” Businessman and the Apprentice winner Mark Wright In comparison, under the leadership of Boris Johnson between 2008 and 2016, the murder rate halved in the city up until 2014 before it increased minimally during the last years of his tenure. Stabbings also significantly decreased, albeit only since 2012, reaching its lowest level just before Johnson left the office, according to the Metropolitan Police  figures . Video The aunt of Kelva Smith, who was fatally stabbed in the abdomen in March this year, told the  BBC  that knife crime was â€œout of controlâ€ in London. Last month, a mother grilled Khan over the growing crime in the city, pointing out that a victim was stabbed almost in front of a closed police station. â€œ[It] happened outside that police station that is closed down, my local police station. There are no [police officers] on our street. Londoners, we don&apost feel safe. Our communities do not feel safe,â€ she told Khan. â€œYou give me statistics, Mr Khan and that&aposs fair enough. But for me as a parent, I&aposm telling you, we do not feel safe. We don&apost feel safe in London,â€ she added. â€œPlease don&apost give me statistics. Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe.â€ ""Give me known facts so I can let my son out in the streets of London and feel safe.â€ â€” A mother told Sadiq Khan during an open forum last month. Khan dismissed the criticism of the woman, saying the police force in London is â€œunder-resourcedâ€ to ensure safety. The mayor has alsoÂ  bemoaned  Trumpâ€™s visit just a day before on financial grounds, saying the city lacks the financial resources to provide safety during the visit, even though Trump is spending the majority of his time away from the capital. This is all while Khan encouraged millions of Londoners to march against the president, adding additional strain to his â€œunder-resourcedâ€ police force. Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation Ken Marsh told  the Evening Standard  that the security costs for the Trump visit could run in to tens of millions of dollars. The state visit of President Barack Obama, thanks to nearly non-existent protests,  cost just over $3 million , with only half of that sum actually spent on ensuring safety during the visit. â€œThat just sums him up,â€ Wright told to Fox News about the costs of policing that could have been saved had the protests been not encouraged by the mayor. â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s got any business knowledge. He doesnâ€™t think for the people, I donâ€™t see him as a caring, forward-thinking individual. Heâ€™s very self-obsessed. And thatâ€™s the qualities he called out in Trump, but I think heâ€™s only generalizing himself.â€ Video Despite the overwhelming problems in the city, Khan is favorite to win the second term in 2020, mostly because no senior Conservative party leaders appears willing to step up and challenge him. Yet Khan must be aware of his slipping popularity. Only half of Londoners believe he&aposs a good mayor, according to a YouGov poll in May â€“ a decrease by almost 10 percent compared to last year â€“ while almost a third of residents think heâ€™s doing a bad job. â€œI think he should be sacked. I think heâ€™s a disgrace for mayor. If I donâ€™t do my job properly I lose my job. Heâ€™s not doing his job properly, heâ€™s disrespecting the most powerful office in the world and heâ€™s only doing it only to gain himself politically,â€ Wright said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-slam-embarrassing-mayor-sadiq-khan-for-feuding-with-trump-while-london-faces-rising-crime-knife-deaths,United Kingdom,Fox News,

          In this June 28 photo, protesters chant, ""Families belong together!"" as they walk to the front doors of the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas.
           (AP) The same judge who praised the Trump administration for its â€œcollaborativeâ€ effort to reunite families separated at the border is now saying he&aposs having second thoughts about whether the government is acting in â€œgood faith.â€ U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw criticized the administration late Friday evening, calling into question the safety of a new plan filed by the Department of Justice to reunite more than 2,500 children over the age of 5 by the July 26 deadline. After Fridayâ€™s hearing, the DOJ filed a reunification plan that would meet the July 26 deadline via ""truncated"" procedures to verify parentage and perform background checks, which exclude DNA testing and other steps to reunify families of children under 5. The administration said the abbreviated vetting puts children at significant safety risk but is needed to meet the deadline. Video Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant health and human services secretary for preparedness and response, said that while he is committed to meeting the deadline, he does not believe ""placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of HHS or my core values."" Sabraw fired back, second-guessing remarks he&aposd made hours earlier. ""It is clear from Mr. Meekins&apos declaration that HHS either does not understand the court&aposs orders or is acting in defiance of them. â€¦ At a minimum, it appears he is attempting to provide cover to defendants for their own conduct in the practice of family separation, and the lack of foresight and infrastructure necessary to remedy the harms caused by that practice.â€ He said that the officialâ€™s statement â€œcalls into questionâ€ his earlier comment that the government was acting in â€œgood faith.â€ Sabraw said that safe reunification could and will occur by July 26.

14/07/2018,2018,7,14,Hans von Spakovsky,We need to hear more about anti-Trump bias by the FBI and Mueller's team -- House hearing must not be the end,"close Video Fiery highlights from chaotic Strzok hearing Verbal fireworks erupt during a joint congressional hearing surrounding the 2016 election with FBI agent Peter Strzok. In his  daylong testimony Thursday  before two U.S. House committees, FBI official Peter Strzok did nothing to counter the conclusion of the Justice Department inspector general that he and other FBI agents â€œdemonstrated extremely poor judgment and a gross lack of professionalismâ€ while investigating the Trump election campaign and the Hillary Clinton email scandal. The televised hearing was contentious â€“ with plenty of fireworks as Republicans attacked Strzok and Democrats praised him â€“ but we didnâ€™t learn much. Strzok refused to answer many questions. He used most of this testimony to claim repeatedly that all of his investigative actions were completely above board â€“ despite strong and ample evidence to the contrary. Both the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees have an obligation to continue their oversight investigations. Americans need to be reassured that biased, partisan and abusive behavior will not be countenanced at the FBI and Justice Department. Strzok was unapologetic and openly defiant at the House hearing. FBI lawyers on numerous occasions instructed him  not  to answer questions about matters that are currently under investigation, continuing the same stalling tactics the FBI and the Justice Department have been engaging in for months. after the hearing Thursday it should be clear to any objective observer that Strzok was desperate to see Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, as shown beyond doubt by the text message Strzok wrote and exchanged with Page. A recently released report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, described â€“ in great detail â€“ extensive misbehavior and potential bias among FBI agents working on the Clinton email investigation and on Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to help Trump win the election. In his report, Horowitz wrote that Strzokâ€™s anti-Trump text messages implied â€œa willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidateâ€™s election prospects.â€ Yet at the crowded hearing, Democratic committee members acted more like Strzokâ€™s defense lawyers than seekers of truth. As Republican members asked questions, Democrats repeatedly interrupted with outbursts and objections. Throughout it all, Strzok denied that his work for the FBI was affected by any of the anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias he displayed in numerous text messages and emails exchanged with his then-lover and then-FBI attorney Lisa Page. He claimed that â€œat no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any actionâ€ he took. President Trumpâ€™s attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani,  tweeted Friday : â€œPeter Strzokâ€™s testimony was a disgrace. It taints the entire Mueller witchunt. President Trump is being investigated by people who possess pathological hatred for him. All the results of the investigation are â€˜fruit of the poison treeâ€™ and should be dismissed.â€ Donâ€™t expect that to happen, but after the hearing Thursday it should be clear to any objective observer that Strzok was desperate to see Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, as shown beyond doubt by the text message Strzok wrote and exchanged with Page. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, castigated Strzok for the former FBI counterintelligence chiefâ€™s Â dubious claim that his opposition to Trumpâ€™s election as president had no impact on his conduct dealing with FBI investigations could influence the outcome of the election. Gohmert stated that FBI agents had told him that Strzok has â€œembarrassed them.â€ The Texas congressman went on to say that he couldnâ€™t â€œhelp but wonder, when I see you (Strzok) looking there with a little smirk, how many times did you look so innocent into your wifeâ€™s eye and lie to her about Lisa Page?â€ With that comment, the hearing room erupted. Gohmert was implying that, by lying to his own wife about his affair with Page, Strzok had demonstrated a willingness to lie and therefore damaged his credibility. Running interference for Strzok, Democrats constantly interrupted Gohmert, objecting to his questioning. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the ranking minority member, accused Gohmert of â€œimpugning the character of the witnessâ€ â€“ as if Strzokâ€™s credibility and honesty were an irrelevant issue. Strzokâ€™s response to Gohmert was that his question said more about the Texanâ€™s â€œcharacter and what you stand for and what is going on inside of you.â€ Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., accused Republican members of the committees of character assassination and demagoguery, comparing the hearing to a Russian show trial. He showed no interest in asking questions pertaining to the hearingâ€™s subject matter or any of the misdeeds recounted in Inspector General Horowitzâ€™s almost 600-page report. Instead, Connolly apologized to Strzok for the FBI agent having to answer any questions at all, devoting the rest of his time to attacking the character of President Trump. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., took a similar tack, spending his questioning time in a tirade against the president. Despite Strzokâ€™s hard-to-believe claims that the anti-Trump bias he displayed had no effect on his behavior and his conduct in the Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., pointed out that Special Council Mueller â€œkicked him (Strzok) offâ€ the Russia investigation when Mueller discovered Strzokâ€™s anti-Trump texts and emails in May 2017. As Gowdy said, the â€œbias manifest in those texts â€¦ made (Strzok) unfit to objectively and passionately investigateâ€ the case. Another member pointed out that the bias shown by Strzok in his written communications would get him excused from a jury and would require a judge to recuse himself from presiding over a case. But Strzok insisted that he had no need to recuse himself from either the Clinton email or Russia investigations. Gowdy told Strzok that he did not â€œappreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016.â€ Amazingly enough, Strzok claimed he couldnâ€™t remember writing some of his most damning text messages. In one text exchange, Page wrote to Strzok, referring to Trump: â€œHeâ€™s not ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€ Strzok replied: â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it.â€ Strzok also texted about having an â€œinsurance policyâ€ against Trump being elected. But Strzok tried to explain his text away by saying he was referring to the general public and his belief that the American people would not elect someone demonstrating the â€œhorrible, disgusting behaviorâ€ of Donald Trump. He also denied that derogatory texts he wrote about Trump supporters were derogatory. However, Strzok acknowledged at the hearing that he â€œdetestedâ€ Trump. One of the most concerning facts that came out was Strzokâ€™s admission that he had not provided Inspector General Horowitz with text messages on his personal phone. So there may be an even bigger treasure trove of texts reflecting Strzokâ€™s attitude and behavior yet to be examined. If the FBI was investigating an ordinary American, the agency would demand access to personal as well business devices and telephones to look for relevant evidence. But Strzok was adamant that he would not provide his personal texts. Why is he getting what appears to be special treatment? Thursdayâ€™s hearing must not be the last we hear about the impact of anti-Trump bias by the FBI and the Mueller team â€“ not just in past investigations that involved Strzok, but in the continuing Mueller probe. All Americans who are subjected to law enforcement investigations â€“ including President Trump and people working for him â€“ are entitled to fair and unbiased treatment from investigators seeking the truth. It certainly appears that Strzok did not give Donald Trump and his campaign that kind of fair treatment, free of political bias. Before we evaluate whatever conclusions the Mueller probe makes when it finally ends, the American people have a right to know if bias by the investigators tainted the validity of those conclusions. We need to hear more about anti-Trump bias by the FBI and Muellerâ€™s team â€“ House hearing must not be the end Thursdayâ€™s House hearings must not be the last we hear about the impact of anti-Trump bias by the FBI and the Mueller team.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/we-need-to-hear-more-about-anti-trump-bias-by-the-fbi-and-muellers-team-house-hearing-must-not-be-the-end,OPINION,Fox News,"

14/07/2018,2018,7,14,Associated Press,Trump wish for warm Putin ties highlights policy disconnect,"WASHINGTON â€“  President Donald Trump&aposs persistence in pursuing friendly ties with Vladimir Putin has highlighted a growing disconnect within his administration over Russia policy. Trump speaks fondly of Putin and a desire for better relations with Moscow, but the rest of his executive branch remains highly critical and deeply suspicious of the Russian president and the Kremlin&aposs intentions. The stark contrast in approaches has been thrown into sharp relief as Trump and Putin prepare for their summit in Finland on Monday, amid unremitting criticism of Russia from Trump&aposs State Department, Justice Department, Treasury Department and Defense Department. That might be explained as a good cop-bad cop strategy with Russia. But the mixed messaging has left America&aposs friends and allies confused, particularly after a contentious NATO summit where Trump questioned the value of the alliance that Putin has long denounced and sought to weaken. Just three days before the Helsinki summit, the Justice Department announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in special counsel Robert Muller&aposs investigation into Moscow&aposs meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That brings to 25 the number of Russians charged in the investigation. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has repeatedly cited Putin&aposs denials of any Russian interference in the campaign, suggesting there is little or nothing he can do to demand accountability. The Kremlin has denied that the Russian state interfered in the election. The indictments were unsealed just hours after Trump again referred to Mueller&aposs inquiry as a ""witch hunt"" and after the president told reporters at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, ""I think I would have a very good relationship with Putin if we spend time together."" A day earlier in Brussels, Trump did say he would raise the election issue with Putin, but also said: ""I don&apost think you&aposll have any &aposGee, I did it, I did it. You got me!&apos There won&apost be Perry Mason here, I don&apost think. But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question."" Trump also has expressed little interest in continuing the harsh U.S. criticism of Russian activities in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere, and of Russia&aposs human rights record. In fact, he&aposs raised doubts about U.S. demands for Russia to return to Ukraine the territory of Crimea it annexed in 2014, and has suggested a bargain could be in the works for Russia&aposs ally Bashar Assad to remain in power indefinitely in Syria. Contrast that with the messaging of the State Department. Under Trump, the department has issued regular stinging critiques of Russia, including on human rights and press freedom. Those have been sustained since former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was installed as top U.S. diplomat in April and despite the president&aposs growing calls for friendship with Putin. Ahead of Russia&aposs national day on June 12, Pompeo said the United States honors ""the citizens of the Russian Federation and their aspirations for the democratic principles of universal freedom, civil liberties, and the rule of law."" On July 6, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert condemned the ""selective targeting"" by Russia of U.S.-funded news organizations. And this Thursday the department criticized a ""pattern of intimidation and violence against those who express dissent across Russia."" Pompeo has also been steadfast in his support of NATO. While Trump was questioning the commitment of NATO allies at this past week&aposs summit in Brussels, where leaders agreed on modest steps to improve military readiness in Europe, principally to counter Russia, Pompeo was lauding the 29-nation grouping as ""the most successful alliance in history."" Pompeo also warned in a tweet: ""Weakness provokes; strength and cohesion protect."" Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has been no less critical of Russia and its attempts to weaken or entirely subvert trans-Atlantic alliances. ""Putin seeks to shatter NATO,"" he told graduates of the U.S. Naval War College last month. ""He aims to diminish the appeal of the Western democratic model and attempts to undermine America&aposs moral authority. His actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals."" Measure that against Trump&aposs suggestion at a rancorous summit of the Group of Seven last month in Canada that the leading industrialized countries include Russia in their elite grouping of democracies â€” a suggestion that got short shrift from the other nations. And as Trump has talked about bringing Putin back into the international fold, the Treasury Department has continued to impose sanctions on various Russian officials, companies and businessmen. Days after the G-7, the Treasury blacklisted five Russian companies and three individuals, some of whom are accused of directly supporting Russia&aposs intelligence agency in its efforts to carry out cyberattacks, including intrusions into America&aposs energy grid and threats to underwater cables that transmit much of the world&aposs communications data.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-wish-for-warm-putin-ties-highlights-policy-disconnect,MILITARY,Fox News,

14/07/2018,2018,7,14,Associated Press,Nuclear arms race is an expected topic for Trump-Putin talks,"WASHINGTON â€“  President Donald Trump seems of two minds on nuclear weapons. He muses about eliminating them but also has called for a U.S. buildup and bragged about his nuclear ""button."" In March, while forecasting a face-to-face meeting on this topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said in the same breath that an arms race was ""getting out of control"" and that he would never allow any country to have weapons ""even close to what we have,"" although Russia already does. How these seemingly competing instincts will play out in his talks Monday with Putin in Helsinki could profoundly affect the direction of U.S. defense policy. Before leaving a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would raise long-standing U.S. allegations that Russia is violating a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty, and whether he favors extending a separate treaty that he has criticized in the past as disadvantaging the U.S. His one-word answer to the two-part question was ""yes"" â€” the first public indication that he wants to extend the New Start treaty, which expires in three years. Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how ""it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation."" Yet Trump&aposs administration has shown little interest in negotiating further reductions in American and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons â€” those capable of striking each other&aposs territory â€” are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow&aposs 2014 annexation of Crimea. The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it&aposs unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ""If they don&apost extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world&aposs two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,"" Kimball said. Analysts have puzzled over Trump&aposs likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin. The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. Putin also has promoted Russia&aposs development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington&aposs missile defense system violate the treaty. Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump-Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ""You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,"" he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile&aposs fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration&aposs updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, ""increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/nuclear-arms-race-is-an-expected-topic-for-trump-putin-talks,MILITARY,Fox News,

Biden made his fiery remarks in Phoenix, Arizona, at an event for the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). He specifically targeted the Justice Departmentâ€™s â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers. â€œGrotesque lies, lies about immigrants, about crime, about costs to the community,â€ said Biden. â€œThis administrationâ€™s policies that literally rip babies from the arms of their mothers and fathers â€” itâ€™s one of the darkest moments in our history.â€ The â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy, in turn, led to an increase in the number of children separated from their parents until Trump signed an executive order ending the practice. â€œNot only is it a national shame, it tarnishes the very idea of America and diminishes our standing in the world,â€ Biden said.

           (Aspen Security Forum via AP) Top American intelligence official Dan Coats is saying he meant no disrespect to President Trump in a televised interview discussing the recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland.

21/07/2018,2018,7,21,Chuck DeVore,"Instead of fighting Trump tax cuts, high-tax states should cut their taxes to boost job creation","close Video What can we expect from tax cuts 2.0? Rep. Kevin Brady recaps the 'exciting' meeting with President Trump. New York, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey â€“ four of the highest-taxing states in the nation â€“ filed a  breathtakingly foolish lawsuit  this week against the federal government alleging that the tax cut and reform legislation signed into law by President Trump last year is unconstitutional because it unfairly targets Democratic-controlled states. The states claim that the federal tax overhaul is nothing more than an attempt by Republicans to pressure them into cutting taxes and reducing the size of government. But the new economic reality brought about by the tax cuts may soon serve as a strong incentive for high-tax states to revisit their tax policies. Thatâ€™s because private sector jobs are being added at an 80 percent higher clip in the low-tax states in the first half of the year. The tax reform passed without receiving any Democratic votes in Congress and was signed into law by President Trump Dec. 22.  The old tax code allowed taxpayers to deduct all of their state and local taxes if they itemized their deductions on their federal income tax returns. The new law, in effect this year, caps the state and local tax deduction at $10,000 per tax return. The 11 states with the highest claimed state and local tax (SALT) deductions are: California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. Not all of these high-tax states are run by Democrats: seven have Democratic governors, while four have Republicans. Legislative control in these high-tax jurisdictions is divided as well, with eight having both chambers controlled by Democrats, two featuring split control, and one controlled by Republicans. Higher-earning taxpayers from New York had the nationâ€™s highest SALT deductions under the old tax law, with somewhere between  30 to 40 percent of filers deducting an average of $21,000  in state and local taxes on their 2014 federal tax returns. New York calculates that its taxpayers will pay $14.3 billion more to the federal government this year. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said of the lawsuit filed by her state and the three others: â€œNew York will not be bullied. This cap is unconstitutional â€“ going well beyond settled limits on federal power to impose an income tax, while deliberately targeting New York and similar states in an attempt to coerce us into changing our fiscal policies and the vital programs they support.â€ Legislators in high-tax states have been looking for ways to circumvent the new federal tax law by reclassifying taxes as charitable deductions â€“ but the Internal Revenue Service is unimpressed and taxpayers who avail themselves of such a ruse expose themselves to federal liability. The deductibility of SALT on federal taxes has been a feature of the federal income tax from the start. But it has been under scrutiny for decades as well. The last serious attempt to limit or eliminate the SALT deduction was in 1986 under President Reagan. The 1986 Tax Reform Act did eliminate sales tax deductibility but continued deductibility for income and property taxes. There were no successful state lawsuits then. And while the recently appointed New York attorney general decries the potential for the change in the federal tax code to â€œcoerceâ€ the state into cutting taxes, real economic conditions may provide all the persuasion that state lawmakers in high-tax states need. As of June, there were: A total of 43.3 million private sector workers in the 11 high-tax states. A total of 41.6 million private sector workers in the 21 states with average SALT deductions. Some 40.8 million such workers in the 18 states with the lowest SALT deductions, including the seven states with no tax on earned income as well as on income from dividends and investments â€“ the most populous being Texas and Florida. Prior to the changes in the federal tax code, semiannual employment growth over the 18 months ending in December 2017 averaged 0.86 percent in the high-tax states, 0.66 percent in the mid-tax states, and 1.07 percent in the low-tax states. According to government statistics released Friday, in the first six months of this year employment growth has picked up throughout the nation, but it has accelerated even more rapidly in the low-tax states â€“ clocking in at 1.48 percent. Thatâ€™s 80 percent faster than the growth rate of only 0.82 percent in the high-tax states. The states with an average tax load experienced 1.04 percent job growth â€“ 27 percent higher than that in the high-tax states. This large disparity in economic performance will, if it continues, place lawmakers in high-tax states under increasing pressure to reform their tax codes and reduce the size of state and local government to attract job-growing investment.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/instead-of-fighting-trump-tax-cuts-high-tax-states-should-cut-their-taxes-to-boost-job-creation,OPINION,Fox News,

Trust your advisers and together youâ€™ll be a YUGE success","close Video President Trump invites Putin for a US visit this fall Trump says he'll be Putin's 'worst enemy' if U.S.-Russia relations 'don't work out.' Kevin Corke reports from the White House. President Trump, who I voted for and support, is a strong and decisive leader â€“ a man of action. He often approaches foreign relations and meetings with leaders of other nations like a boxer â€“ standing alone, fighting hard for the best interests the United States. The events of the past few days involving his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin show heâ€™d be wise to start acting more like the quarterback of a great football team. With his background as the head of a private company with a relatively small staff, President Trump is used to making deals one-one-one with other corporate executives. That worked for his business empire and made him a billionaire. But the responsibilities of the presidency are much broader, the decisions far more complex, and the number of issues any president has to deal with are enormous. No president can possibly master the details of every issue he must deal with. Thatâ€™s why â€“ like a great quarterback â€“ he has a team surrounding him. Just as no quarterback can take the field alone and win a football game, no president can handle his job â€“ particularly the challenges of foreign policy and national security â€“ by himself. As a strong supporter of President Trump â€“ and as someone who has served as an assistant secretary of state under Colin Powell and as a White House staffer under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush â€“ I want to give President Trump this helpful advice: rely on your outstanding team of Cabinet members and senior advisers. This is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength. Candidly, the president should not have met alone with Putin and only translators for about two hours at their summit in Finland on Monday. President Trump should have been accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary James Mattis, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, perhaps a handful of other officials, and a note-taker. The president was wise to select this A-Team of senior officials â€“ probably the most talented assembled since the Reagan presidency â€“ to advise him and execute his policies. He needs to trust them and use them. But they canâ€™t do their jobs if theyâ€™re not in the room when he meets with his foreign counterparts and if theyâ€™re not consulted on major decisions. Embarrassingly, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was surprised to learn Thursday from NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell â€“ during a televised interview â€“ that President Trump had invited Putin to visit the White House. And when Coats was asked what Presidents Trump and Putin discussed in their private meeting  he responded : â€œI donâ€™t know what happened in that meetingâ€ â€“ three days after the meeting was held. The president should have consulted Coats, the senior officials mentioned above, and CIA Director Gina Haspel before extending his invitation to Putin. Similarly, he should consult with his team before making significant decisions dealing with North Korea, China, NATO nations and other nations around the globe. Ultimately, of course, President Trump makes the final decisions â€“ thatâ€™s as it should be. But he should take advantage of the brainpower and experience of his team. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re there, to support him and help him succeed on behalf of our nation. President Trump needs to take his star players out of the locker room, put them on the field, and take advantage of their experience and talents. Together, the presidentâ€™s A-Team has more than 300 years of experience in foreign policy, the military and national security positions. They are wise, honest and great patriots. To cite just one example from my own personal experience: National Security Adviser John Bolton, with whom I worked at the State Department, is a tried-and-true thinker, drawing his advice from decades of intense study of foreign motivations, machinations, historical steps and missteps â€“ especially dealing with the countries President Trump most needs to understand. In addition to relying on his A-Team to attend meetings he holds with foreign leaders and to review big decision before he announces them in remarks or a tweet, the president should invite criticism internally. He needs to slow down enough to recognize that no human being can possibly know everything and be right 100 percent of the time. The president should hear the plusses and minuses of his ideas from his senior advisers before he makes those ideas public. He should hear what they have to say about possible consequences of actions he would like to take. He should ask them tough questions and let them ask him tough questions. International relations and national security should not be conducted like an exercise in public relations or a reality TV show. And while the president is understandably averse to endless pondering and delays in decision-making â€“ something that plagued the Obama White House â€“ he needs to accept that fact that sometimes snap decisions made without consulting experts can turn out to be the wrong decisions. Hereâ€™s the bottom line: President Trump is a brilliant leader, and his slogan of Make America Great Again motivates everything he does. He has been unfairly dogged by a long, drawn-out investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that is harming our nation and that has produced no evidence that he has engaged in wrongdoing. Millions of American voted for Donald Trump because they wanted the disruptive leadership he promised, with the goal of steering our nation in a new direction, after a dismal eight years under President Obama. But the president canâ€™t succeed â€“ and America canâ€™t succeed â€“ if he operates alone, ignoring and excluding the outstanding public servants he has chosen as his A-Team. By trusting in his team President Trump can avert geopolitical landmines, unintended ambiguities and the consequences of loosely used words. He can avoid accidental missteps, mixed messages, misunderstandings and misfires. He should let his team out of the locker room and have them join him on the field and in the huddle.Â  With his full team fielded, he will run up the score.

President Trump on Saturday described former lawyer Michael Cohenâ€™s taping of a private conversation between them as â€œtotally unheard of & perhaps illegal,â€ but he reassured supporters that he has done nothing wrong. Trump did not mention Cohen by name but appeared to be responding to reports that Cohen recorded a conversation with him in September 2016 in which they discussed possible payments to former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed she had an affair with Trump in 2006. The New York Times Â first reported that the FBI seized the recording during the raid earlier this year on Cohenâ€™s office as part of an investigation into the former Trump lawyer&aposs payments to women to shut down stories about his client leading up to the 2016 election -- a practice known as â€œcatch-and-kill.â€ Fox News has confirmed the details of the tape. On Saturday, Trump appeared to slam both the FBI raid and Cohenâ€™s behavior as â€œinconceivable.â€ â€œInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyerâ€™s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,â€ he tweeted. â€œEven more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal.â€ But, possibly in reference to questions about whether he had violated any campaign finance laws, Trump added that â€œyour favorite President did nothing wrong!â€ COHEN TAPED DISCUSSION WITH TRUMP ABOUT POSSIBLE PAYMENT TO PLAYBOY MODELÂ  Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani had expressed a similar sentiment when he told the Times that while there was a discussion, the payment was never made and the tape showed that Trump had done nothing wrong. Video â€œNothing in that conversation suggests that he had any knowledge of it in advance,â€ Giuliani told The Times. He also said that Trump told Cohen that any payment should be by check, not cash, so it could be documented properly. â€œIn the big scheme of things, itâ€™s powerful exculpatory evidence,â€ he said. The Wall Street Journal Â reported in November 2016 that McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc. -- the parent company to the National Enquirer -- for the rights to the story, but it never ran. The FBI is also investigating Cohenâ€™s payment of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the election in exchange for silence about an alleged one-time encounter with Trump.

21/07/2018,2018,7,21,Catherine Herridge,DOJ releases FISA docs that formed basis for surveillance of ex-Trump adviser Carter Page,"close Video Darrell Issa reacts to release of Carter Page FISA documents FBI releases documents related to the Carter Page FISA warrant; Rep. Darrell Issa weighs in on 'Justice with Judge Jeanine.' The Department of Justice has released documents used by the government to justify the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page, a former campaign adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump. The materials released by the DOJ include an October 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page as well as several renewal applications. It is highly unusual for documents related to FISA wiretap applications to be released. Though heavily redacted,  the documents  show that the infamous and unverified Steele Dossier was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant.Â The dossier, which was opposition research funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign, contains salacious allegations against Trump. It was also a major component used to justify subsequent renewals. The visible sections of the released FISA documents do not indicate the dossier was ever verified. Instead, the FBI claimed that Steele was â€œreliableâ€ based on his previous work. The FISA records also reveal that aÂ September 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was a significant part of the government&aposs warrant application. But London court records show, and Republicans emphasize, that Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS --Â the opposition research firm behind the Steele Dossier. WATCH: DARRELL ISSA REACTS TO RELEASE OF FISA DOCUMENTS Video The newly released FISA warrant application, however, seems to indicate the Yahoo News article was an independent piece of corroborating information that justified the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans question whether the story is an example of circular reporting that merely repeated information from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier. Based on what is visible, the dossier is not described to the FISA court as a political document, as the Democrats have asserted; in fact, the FBI speculates to the FISA court that it was commissioned to damage Candidate 1, who is Donald Trump. Page&aposs denials of the Yahoo News reporting were included in the early renewals to the FISA application.Â The last renewal in late Spring 2017 is particularly important, because by that point, the FBI had dumped Steele as a source after he misled them over his media contacts. One of the documents reads: â€œThe FBI speculates to the FISA court that the U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit candidate 1â€™s campaign."" Fox News believes that the U.S. person is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS. HOUSE MEMO: DISPUTED DOSSIER KEY TO FBI FISA WARRANT TO SURVEIL TRUMP TEAM The unredacted FISA materials also contain only limited references to ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos.Â Media reports had speculated that Papadopoulos&apos 2016 meeting in London with a professor who had ties to Russia was a keyÂ justification for the FISA-authorized surveillance of Page. Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in Special Counsel Robert Mueller&aposs probe. Critics have charged that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the FISA application renewals, should not have approved them without more reliable intelligence. Reacting to the document release, Page told Fox News, ""I&aposm having trouble finding any small bit of this document that rises above complete ignorance and/or insanity."" President Trump also weighed in on Twitter Sunday, calling the situation a ""scam."" ""Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,"" Trump wrote. ""Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!"" Video The surveillance of Page became a contentious matter between Republican and Democratic lawmakers earlier this year. Republicans alleged the FBI had abused its surveillance powers and improperly obtained the warrant, a charge that Democrats rebutted as both sides characterized the documents in different ways. The documents, meanwhile, remained out of public view. WATCH: CARTER PAGE SPEAKS OUT House Democrats were quick to say that the documents bolstered their arguments. ""For more than a year, House Republicans have bullied the Department of Justice and FBI to release highly sensitive documents to derail the Special Counsel&aposs and other legitimate national security investigations and cover for the President,"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ""For the sake of our national security and our democracy, these vital investigations must be allowed to continue unhindered by Republican interference. The GOP must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies."" U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the documents underscore the ""legitimate concern"" the FBI had about Page&aposs activities. Yet Schiff said the materials shouldn&apost have been released during an ongoing investigation because of national security. Schiff blamed  Trump for making public the House Republicans&apos initial memo about the FISA applications , a move by Trump that the congressman called ""nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to to (sic) interfere with the Special Counsel&aposs investigation."" Earlier this year, GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a memo claiming the DOJ abused the FISA warrant process in order to hurt Trump&aposs presidentialÂ campaign, claiming the warrant against Page was based in significant part on the Steele Dossier. Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the FBI, which warned that the document contained â€œmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memoâ€™s accuracy,â€ the Hill report said.

          Safe space: Part of the problem is there aren't as many Trump-friendly bars in D.C. compared to past administrations; the Benjamin Bar &amp; Lounge (pictured) is an option but generally expensive
           (Trump Hotel) Trying to find love in D.C. can be tricky. If youâ€™re a young Trump administration staffer, it might be near impossible. GOP employees and other right-wingers have been complaining that dating in one of the most Democratic cities in America is a political minefield. Theyâ€™ve been called out, flipped off and told they are personally responsible for the death of democracy. One 29-year-old lobbyist told Fox News that learning to date in a Trump world is â€œabsolutely insane.â€ â€œItâ€™s getting so bad,â€ the lobbyist, who asked to remain anonymous because she works with the administration, said. She, like several people Fox News spoke to, says theyâ€™re often raked over hot coals by prospective dates online or simply denied when someone finds out they work â€“ or even voted â€“ for President Trump. WHATABURGER PATRON, BULLIED FOR WEARING &aposMAGA&apos HAT, GETS NEW CAP SIGNED BY TRUMP: REPORT Another person who works for the Trump administration said she has endured insults for simply posing with the American flag. â€œGuys say, â€˜Are you one of those Trumpies?â€™ Itâ€™s ridiculous,â€ she laments. â€œHow did posing with the American flag turn me into a country-hating loser?â€ Capitol Hill staffer Daniel Jativa said he got the brush off when a girl he was dating found out he accepted a job with a Republican congressman who aligned closely with the House Freedom Caucus. 
      Ted Dooley, executive director of the college Republican National Committee, who met his wife while campaigning for Charlie Baker in 2014 in Cape Cod, Mass., suggests Republicans look to the party for love
       (Ted Dooley Twitter) â€œI always considered myself a more moderate Republican so some of the things we did talk about, I generally agreed with â€“ things like frustration over partisanship, gridlock, how the discourse against certain groups of people have become unfortunately darker,â€ he said. GOP INTERNS: UBER DRIVER REFUSED US SERVICE BECAUSE OF MAGA HATS He says when the girl found out his boss leaned conservative, Jativa â€œwas immediately called â€˜disgustingâ€™ and an â€˜enablerâ€™ of racismâ€¦ of misogyny.â€ Suffice it to say, they called it quits. Another senior Hill staffer told Fox News that sheâ€™s been harassed on dating sites so much that she and her friends â€œstick to our ownâ€ these days. â€œItâ€™s disheartening,â€ she said. â€œBasically, we now all date one another. Itâ€™s safer that way. I have a group of friends who are all pretty conservative and we end up dating in the same circle. I didnâ€™t think coming to the heart of the nationâ€™s capital would be like this, but itâ€™s a reality these days.â€ I try to steer the conversation away from politics as much as humanly possible. It doesnâ€™t help in the long run but it gets me out of a lengthy lecture about how I am ruining the country. â€” Janine Olsen Ted Dooley, executive director of the college Republican National Committee, says heâ€™s heard numerous horror stories of conservatives being berated for their beliefs. â€œIt reflects the larger tone of our environment that extremists like (Rep.) Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.), are encouraging fringe extremists on the political left to verbally and physically berate those with differing opinions,â€ he told Fox News. â€œItâ€™s no surprise that her encouragement has seeped into the personal interactions young people have in all aspects of their lives.â€ Relationship expert Christine Bacon said she isnâ€™t surprised by the open hostility from the left. â€œIt saddens me,â€ she said. Bacon, an evangelical Catholic who met her husband in a nightclub 35 years ago, adds that â€œopposites attract but not in terms of politics because itâ€™s typically based on personality â€“ introverts versus extroverts type of thing.â€ One 31-year-old woman  Politico interviewed  laid out a typical date: â€œYou do the small-talk thing, and you have a very good conversation, and then they might say, &aposYou didn&apost vote for Trump, right?&aposâ€ She adds, â€œAs soon as I say, &aposOf course I did,&apos it just devolves into all-caps &aposHOW COULD YOU BE SUCH A RACIST AND A BIGOT?&apos And &aposYou&aposre going to take away your own birth control.&apos"" Video Given the backlash, some pro-Trump supporters looking for love say they arenâ€™t above bending the truth. â€œI try to steer the conversation away from politics as much as humanly possible,â€ conservative lobbyist Janine Olsen told Fox News. â€œIt doesnâ€™t help in the long run but it gets me out of a lengthy lecture about how I am ruining the country. Iâ€™m not lying. Iâ€™m just not offering up my political positions on the first date anymore.â€ Part of the problem Olsen admits is there arenâ€™t as many Trump-friendly watering holes as there were during the Obama and Bush administrations. Just four percent of the Districtâ€™s votes in 2016 went to Trump. While the Benjamin Bar & Lounge at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. is widely considered a â€œsafe spaceâ€ for Republicans, basic Bellinis start at $15 with other signature cocktails going as high as $100 a pop. Such prices are not financially feasible for the average Washington worker. â€œIâ€™m more of a Guinness gal anyway,â€ Olsen said with a laugh. Dooley, who met his wife while campaigning for Charlie Baker in 2014 in Cape Cod, Mass., suggests Republicans look to the party for love. â€œThe number of friends I have who have met their significant others through their involvement in campaigns of CRs is significant,â€ he said. â€œGet out there, elect Republicans, and enjoy the people you meet doing it.

Sulzberger took on the president 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the Twitter feud between President Trump and The New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger. It was somewhat encouraging to learn that President Trump was willing to invite the publisher of what he constantly attacks as the ""failing"" New York Times to talk through their differences. As I reported in my book, Trump has had other off-the-record sitdowns with such journalists as Chuck Todd, and also George Stephanopoulos, that serve as venting sessions and keep the lines of communications open. But then, as so often happens with the president and the press, it all dissolved into acrimony. Trump revealed the ""very good and interesting"" July 20 meeting with A.G. Sulzberger, and Editorial Page Editor James Bennet, in a tweet.  He said they spent much time talking ""about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, &aposEnemy of the People.&apos Sad!"" That opened the door, as the lawyers say, for Sulzberger to fight back. The 37-year-old rookie publisher wasn&apost about to leave an image that he was summoned for a lecture. So he issued a tough statement assailing Trumpâ€™s ""deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric"": ""I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous. ""I told him that although the phrase &aposfake news&apos is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists &aposthe enemy of the people.&apos I warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence."" No way Trump was going to let that go unanswered. In a tweetstorm, the president said it was the news business that is endangering people: ""When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! Very unpatriotic!"" He also said: ""I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry."" So now we have a situation where each side is accusing the other of jeopardizing lives. The president has every right to push back against the overwhelmingly negative coverage he receives. As one example on the commentary side, the Times doesn&apost have one pro-Trump columnist. Its conservative op-ed writers seem to rip him with as much fervor as the liberal ones. If the media jack up everything to 11, from Putin to family separation to a Michael Cohen tape about a Playboy model, then much of the coverage gets reduced to background noise. But I wish the president would stop the ""enemy"" and ""unpatriotic"" language, which may excite his base but does cross a red line. News organizations have a long history of withholding, softening or delaying national security secrets when officials make the case that lives could be at stake. But the press has been reporting on what Trump calls ""internal deliberations of our government"" since the founding of the republic. Itâ€™s hardly unpatriotic to report on problems involving the head of the EPA or HHS, which forced out both Scott Pruitt and Tom Price. Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet declined to attend the meeting, telling BuzzFeed that he doesn&apost like talking to top officials off the record and that ""I don&apost want to be courted or wooed."" But it&aposs actually healthy that Sulzberger and Bennet sat down with Trump to mutually air their grievances. It&aposs too bad the session wound up escalating tensions instead of reducing them.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/olive-branch-crumbles-trump-vs-ny-times-publisher,Media Buzz,Fox News,

           NEW YORK â€“  George Takei has been vocal about his distaste for President Donald Trump and now the ""Star Trek"" actor has made an app in hopes of making a ""little mockery"" of today&aposs political climate. Takei&aposs new app, ""House of Cats,"" is an augmented reality app that allows users to place a cartoon cat with some of President Donald Trumpâ€™s features into photos and videos with their friends and family. ""Trumpy Cat"" is joined by fellow feline characters such as ""Meowlania,"" ""Vladdy Putin"" and ""Lilâ€™ Rocket Pug."" Takei said he made the app to lighten the mood. ""Well, Iâ€™m a political animal, and Iâ€™m also a cat lover,"" Takei told Fox News. ""Now, we live in very, very intensely fraught times. You can get completely wrapped up in it, but if you take some steps back and see it in a larger context, these fraught times are absolutely preposterous. Theyâ€™re absurd and itâ€™s just laughable when you get that context and distance. ""So, combining politics and cats, we have an opportunity to laugh at it and make satire out of it. A little mockery of the situation, and I think thatâ€™s necessary for good health. To get a little tonic of laughter into oneâ€™s life,"" he told us. Takei, who boasts more than 10 million followers on Facebook, has been very outspoken in the past over his dislike of the Trump administration. A percentage of the appâ€™s proceeds will be donated to  Refugees International , he said. ""Well right now Iâ€™m very close and very much involved in the turbulence of the times, and we need to be. Democracy is a very fragile thing,"" Takei said. ""When I was a teenager, my father told me that our democracy is a peopleâ€™s democracy, and people have the potential and the history of doing great things. America is great because of the history that we have, the ideals we hold dear. But, people are also fallible and we have a history of all the mistakes we made as a nation. One of them being what affected me as a 5-year-old child."" Takei and his family were among many Japanese-Americans placed in internment camps following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent involvement of the United States in World War II. Today, heâ€™s not shy about drawing parallels between those experiences and whatâ€™s going on now. Video ""We happened to look just like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor, but we Japanese Americans are Americans. My mother was born in Sacramento, my father was a native San Franciscan,"" Takei shared. ""They met and married in Los Angeles and my brother and sister and I were born in Los Angeles. We are Americans. ""To imprison us just because we look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor is, in one context, absolutely absurd. I mean, there was no due process, there were no charges, no trial, no proof of anything,"" he continued. ""America did learn the lesson of that experience during WWII, but our leaders, our political leaders, our elected leaders have not learned that lesson and are repeating it all over again."" While Takei is vocal in his political activism, his social media presence is mostly lighthearted, sharing funny videos, memes and thoughts with his slew of followers. Takei appeared as Hikaru Sulu in 52 episodes of the original â€œStar Trekâ€ series, six of the movies and has lent his voice and face to countless side projects set in the universe created by Gene Roddenberry in 1966. Takei never forgot his roots in â€œStar Trekâ€ and continues to support the ongoing franchise. When asked if heâ€™d be open to reprising his role as Sulu in any upcoming project, such as the rebooted movie franchise started by director J.J. Abrams in 2009, he jumped at the idea. â€œOh no, no. Iâ€™m eager to come back,â€ he told Fox News. â€œThe question is, â€˜is J.J. Abrams ready for me?â€™â€ When asked what piece of technology that exists in the world of â€œStar Trekâ€ that hasnâ€™t yet made its way to the real world, he knew exactly what he wanted. â€œIn the course of my work, I have to get on planes and dash back and forth, not only all over the country but all over the world,â€ he said. â€œSo, the one thing that Iâ€™m most earnestly, devoutly hoping for is the acceleration and development of what we called the transporter.â€",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/george-takei-explains-new-trump-inspired-app-says-democracy-is-a-very-fragile-thing,Viral,Fox News,
31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Adam Shaw,"Dems lash out at Trump over 3D gun decision, call settlement a 'death warrant'","close Video States sue to block online blueprints for 3D-printed guns 8 states file suit against the Trump administration over its decision to allow Defense Distributed to publish downloadable blueprints for guns; Anita Vogel reports on the case. Democrats launched an 11th-hour bid Tuesday to stall a Trump administration settlement allowing a company to share blueprints for 3D-printed guns online, issuing dire warnings that the president will have ""blood"" on his hands if he doesn&apost intervene. Curiously, some of the most heated statements came after President Trump tweeted about his reservations over the 3D-gun decision. ""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesnâ€™t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted Tuesday morning. But it&aposs unclear whether the president is planning to seek any further changes. ""The president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard Air Force One late Tuesday. ""In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law. Video ""We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments,"" Gidley added. The Trump administration in June had settled a lawsuit from a Texas-based company, allowing the company to resume posting the blueprints after it had been stopped from doing so under the Obama administration in 2013. The companyâ€™s website has said downloads will be allowed Wednesday, though blueprints have been posted since Friday. On Monday, eight states filed suit against the administration, while attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back from the settlement. Congressional Democrats kept the pressure up Tuesday with a series of fiery statements to the media. ""Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable, plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country if he does not act today,â€ Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said at a press conference. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said if Trump fails to act, ""blood is going to be on his hands."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went a step further and said the settlement was â€œa death warrant for countless innocent men, women and children.â€ 3D-PRINTED GUN BLUEPRINTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED, ENDING LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE â€œThe Trump Administrationâ€™s sickening NRA giveaway undermines the very foundations of public safety. Metal detectors and other security measures will be completely useless against the flood of undetectable and untraceable â€˜ghost gunsâ€™ that the GOP is inviting into our schools, workplaces, airports and public buildings,â€ she said in a statement. While the blueprints can be printed using a 3D printer, industry experts told The Associated Press that such printers are expensive, the guns can disintegrate quickly, and normal guns are easier to access. Still, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced legislation to block the online publication of such blueprints. â€œThese 3D-printed plastic firearms can evade our detection systems and are a direct threat to our national security,â€ Nelson said at a press conference Tuesday to announce the bill. â€œAnd we are going to let these go up on the internet tonight at midnight?â€ While the Trump administration agreed to the settlement, Trump indicated Tuesday that he had spoken to the National Rifle Association (NRA) about his concerns. His tweet drew the ire of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked: â€œWhat kind of incompetence and dangerous governing is this?â€ NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch argued that the backlash has erupted merely because of Trump administration involvement. â€œPeople have been making guns at home for personal use for ages, plastic (not undetectable, still uses metal) or not. People are acting like this is a new thing because MUH TRUMP, apparently,â€ she said. Late Tuesday, NRA Executive Director Chris Cox said: â€œMany anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms. ""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,"" Cox added.

It comes after 19 months of under-the-radar reporting and late-night interviews. The Watergate reporter who helped take down President Richard Nixon is going after Donald Trump with the surprise upcoming book, &aposFear,&apos scheduled to hit stores on Sept. 11 after 19 months of under-the-radar reporting and late-night interviews. The  Daily Mail reported  that Bob Woodward kept the book a â€œsecretâ€ for the past 19 months, so that he could work on it in private. â€œ&aposFearâ€™Â is the most acute and penetrating portrait of a sitting president ever published during the first years of an administration,â€ Simon & Schuster president Jonathan Karp  said in a statement  on Monday when the book was announced. According to the Washington Post â€“ where Woodward has worked for 47 years â€“ the Watergate icon kept a â€œlow profileâ€ while working on the book. â€œThe author has told friends, heâ€™s gone back to some of the signature moves of his youthful reporting days,â€ Washington Post reporter Manuel Roig-FranziaÂ  wrote . A press release for â€œFear,â€ bills the book as an unprecedentedÂ look into â€œthe harrowing life inside Donald Trumpâ€™s White House and how the president makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies.â€ Woodward conducted â€œhundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand sourcesâ€ for the book that claims to bring â€œto light the explosive debates that drive decision-making in the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One and the White House residence.â€ 
      Journalism legends Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein shared a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Watergate.
       Woodward shared a Pulitzer Prize with Carl Bernstein for the Washington Postâ€™s coverage of the Watergate scandal that helped uncover details that resulted in Nixonâ€™s resignation.Â Bernstein â€“ now a CNN contributor -- has been a harsh critic of President Trump â€œThis is the inside story on President Trump as only Bob Woodward can tell it,â€ Karp said. â€œThe expected tenor of the book is underscored by its unsettling cover, an extreme close-up of a squinty-eyed Trump depicted through a gauzy red filter,â€ Roig-Franzia  wrote . The Post also noted that WoodwardÂ has been showing up â€œat important peopleâ€™s houses unannounced to ask for interviewsâ€ late at night and has told friends that reporting on Trump has felt like a â€œrebirth.â€ Woodward was played by iconic actor Robert Redford in the 1976 film, â€œAll the Presidentâ€™s Men,â€ which was based on the book he co-authored with Bernstein about their Watergate reporting. â€œFearâ€ will be Woodwardâ€™s 19th book for Simon & Schuster. Twelve of them have become No. 1 national bestsellers. Trump was not interviewed for â€œFearâ€ according to The Daily Mail, which suggests the title comes from a 2016 interview that Woodward and political reporter Robert Costa conducted with then-candidate Trump. â€œReal power is through respectâ€¦ real power is, I don&apost even want to use the word, &aposfear,â€™â€ Trump reportedly told Woodward and Costa during the interview.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/watergate-legend-bob-woodward-goes-after-donald-trump-with-secret-book-fear,Media,Fox News,"

31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Associated Press,Trump administration considering tax break on capital gains,"close Video Trumpâ€™s tax cuts have improved US economy: Rep. MacArthur Rep. Tom MacArthur (R.-N.J.) discusses how politicians and President Trump are working on a new tax reform bill. WASHINGTON-- The Trump administration is studying the idea of implementing a big tax break for wealthy Americans by reducing the taxes levied on capital gains, but no decision has been made yet on whether to proceed. Administration officials said Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prefers deferring to Congress. But he does have his department studying the economic impact of such a change and the legality of proceeding without congressional approval. The change would involve taxing capital gains -- profits on investments such as stocks or real estate -- after taking into account inflation, which would lower the tax bite. Capital gains taxes are currently determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference without adjusting for inflation. For example, a stock purchased in 1990 for $100,000 and sold today for $300,000 would produce a $200,000 capital gain. That amount, taxed at the top capital gains rate of 23.8 percent, would result in a tax bill of $47,600. However, if the $200,000 gain was trimmed to just $103,000 by adjusting for inflation over the past 28 years, the tax bill would be $24,514. Indexing capital gains for inflation would reduce federal revenue by about $102 billion over a decade, according to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that about 90 percent of the benefits would go to the top 1 percent of households. The New York Times and the Washington Post reported Tuesday that the proposal was under active consideration by the administration. It has long been supported by Larry Kudlow, head of the president&aposs National Economic Council. Mnuchin, however, has signaled caution in approaching the idea. Republicans, led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady is leading an effort to extend and expand the $1.5 trillion tax cut President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last December. ""If it can&apost get done through a legislative process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we&aposll consider that,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with the Times in which he emphasized that he has not yet concluded that Treasury has the authority to act alone. ""We are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth,"" Mnuchin told the Times. Democrats, however, vowed to oppose the change to how capital gains are taxed. ""Once again, Republicans have exposed the true priorities of their tax scam: billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest at the expense of everyone else,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ""American families are drowning under the weight of stagnant wages, higher health costs and soaring prescription drug costs, but the GOP continues to pick their pockets to give more handouts to the wealthiest 1 percent."" In an interview in June with The Wall Street Journal, Mnuchin declined to speculate on whether Treasury has the legal authority to make the capital gains change on its own. Democrats in the Senate have urged Mnuchin not to take the step, saying Treasury does not have the authority. They pointed to legal opinions written by the Justice and Treasury departments in 1992 finding that Congress intended the word ""cost"" to mean the price paid in nominal dollars -- without adjusting for inflation. Treasury acting on its own ""would almost exclusively benefit the wealthiest Americans, add $100 billion to the ballooning deficit, further complicate the tax code and ignore the need for congressional"" approval, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and other Democratic panel members said in a letter to Mnuchin in May. ""The $100 billion price tag is a conservative estimate because it does not consider the abundant tax-sheltering opportunities that would arise,"" the Democrats wrote. ""Further, the proposal would fail American workers, investment and the larger U.S. economy.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-considering-tax-break-on-capital-gains,White House,Fox News,

          Kim Kardashian met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office to talk about pardoning the Alice Marie Johnson who had served 20 years in prison for crimes connected to a local drug ring.
           (Twitter) Kim Kardashian-West appeared on â€œJimmy Kimmel Liveâ€ Monday night where she discussed her recent campaign to see Alice Johnson released from prison. She revealed that she was in a bit of a state of nature when President Donald Trump called her to inform her that heâ€™d commuted Johnsonâ€™s sentence. â€œI knew there was only one person in power that could make this change and get this woman out of prison that was serving a life sentence, so I went for it,â€ Kardashian-West told the late-night host. As previously reported , Kardashian-West took up Johnsonâ€™s cause after reading about her online. The 63 year old was a nonviolent drug offender who was serving a life sentence. The reality starâ€™s zeal to see Johnson freed took her all the way to the Oval Office where she personally convinced Trump to commute the sentence. ""He called me,"" she recounted. ""I was at a Steven Klein photoshoot. And if anyone knows who he is, it&aposs pretty much a nude shoot. So, I&aposm naked, and my phone rings and I&aposm all glammed up."" She recalled frantically looking for a robe to wear while she had her brief chat with the president.  â€œDid the president know you were just in a robe and nothing else?â€ Kimmel asked. â€œBecause he probably would have released the whole prison if you told him.â€ Kardashian then recalled how grateful she was to then be the person to deliver the news to Johnson that she would be released from prison. ""I&aposm very grateful, I&aposm very hopeful more good things will come out of our meeting,"" she said of meeting Trump. Kardashian says sheâ€™ll continue to fight for prison reform, especially now that she has the ear of the president. However, when pressed about her political leanings, she was honest in that she doesnâ€™t support many of the republican presidentâ€™s policies. Kimmel then asked about her husband, Kanye West, who recently  tweeted his support of Donald Trump . â€œTo make it clear, [when Kanye] would talk about it and we would talk policies, he doesnâ€™t necessarily agree with his policies.

Like a baseball team that is way behind going into the fifth inning, Democrats (and socialists) are hoping for the political equivalent of a rainout, so that the game President Trump is winning will be canceled, allowing them time to regroup. The presidentâ€™s opponents are going to need more than that figurative cancellation, however; theyâ€™re going to need a real plan of action. Democrats, whose policies of tax, spend and regulate, are being reversed, seem to have nothing to offer except failed policies that have slowed growth and discouraged business expansion. Their â€œpolicyâ€ is a vain hope that â€œscandalâ€ and Russian â€œcollusionâ€ will lead to Trumpâ€™s downfall. So far that strategy isnâ€™t working. His base continues to support him. During the 2016 campaign when candidate Trump  pledged  a growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 4 percent, â€œexpertsâ€ claimed it was impossible. President Obama said we would have to accept much smaller growth because the days of rapid economic expansion were over. The left is coming up with all sorts of excuses, including the export of large amounts of soybeans, to explain 4.1 percent GDP growth as a one-off. Some of the same â€œexpertsâ€ who claimed such growth was impossible now say it is unsustainable. Letâ€™s recall that other â€˜expertsâ€ said there was no way Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton. And yet the media continue to return to these people, as they might a soothsayer, hoping they will get it right next time. President Obama once said it was impossible to bring back manufacturing. At a 2016 PBS town hall event, Obama derisively said: â€œWell, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? Thereâ€™s no answer to it.""  Within days of his inauguration, the  Dow Jones  industrial average climbed above the 20,000 mark for the first time. As of last Friday the Dow stood at  25,451 , a  5,000-point  rise. Retirees with their 401k accounts and other investments must be happy with those numbers.  Low unemployment  figures for African Americans and Hispanics (President Trump  claims  they are the lowest in history â€œbecause of my policies,â€ even though black unemployment had been on a years-long downward trend when he assumed office) nonetheless have fueled a hiring boom. Tax cuts and tax reform have put more money in the pockets of some Americans to spend (or save) on goods and services, producing more of them and leading to the hiring of more people, who will pay more taxes. The Treasury last quarter again took in record amounts of revenue, though Congress spends it faster than it comes in. It appears the president may have won a significant battle in the trade war with a promise last week from European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to  negotiate  zero tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum; something else the â€œexpertsâ€ said was impossible. The president is on the way to winning this battle because of his assertion that the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other countries that slap tariffs and taxes on American goods while we import their products with few or no penalties. President Obama once said it was impossible to bring back manufacturing. At a 2016 PBS town hall event, Obama derisively  said : â€œWell, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? Thereâ€™s no answer to it,â€ adding, â€œHe just says, â€˜Well, Iâ€™m going to negotiate a better deal.â€™ Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesnâ€™t have an answer.â€ Would Mr. Obama like salt or salsa on the words he should eat?

Gunn's experience is in sharp contrast to the treatment of Roseanne Barr after she made her own offensive remarks on social media. The cast of Marvelâ€™s â€œGuardians of the Galaxyâ€ released aÂ  statement on Monday in support Â of embattled director James Gunn, and though his A-list pals criticized his tweets that joked about rape and pedophilia, they ultimately rallied around him. Gunn&aposs experience is in sharp contrast to the way the colleagues of Roseanne Barr behaved when she made her own offensive remarks on social media. Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that itâ€™s â€œfrustratingâ€ to see that the Guardians have gone from â€œprotecting us from evil to rationalizingâ€ it.Â Gainor pointed out that Barr is an outspoken conservative while Gunn is liberal. â€œWe get to watch Hollywood line up to guard director James Gunn over his pedophilia comments, while coworkers scurried away from Roseanne like she was radioactive. The world is very forgiving -- but only if you are a liberal in Hollywood,â€ Gainor said. Gunn was recently fired from helming the third installment in the Disney franchise after offensive tweets he wrote several years ago resurfaced. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementeiff and Michael Rooker all signed an open letter addressing the issue and calling for Gunn to be reinstated as the filmâ€™s director. â€œWe get to watch Hollywood line up to guard director James Gunn over his pedophilia comments, while coworkers scurried away from Roseanne like she was radioactive."" â€” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor  Meanwhile, the Disney-owned ABC canceled â€œRoseanneâ€ after the pro-Trump comedian tweeted a racist remark about former President Obama&aposs aide Valerie Jarrett. While Gunnâ€™s colleagues have come to his defense, Barr&aposs co-stars Sara Gilbert, Michael Fishman and Emma Kenney expressed her disappointment in the comedian&aposs tweet. ABC is launching a spinoff series â€œThe Connersâ€ which will feature the family from Lanford, Ill. minus the title character that made them famous, Roseanne. Cast members Gilbert, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Lecy Goranson and Michael Fishman are set to reprise their roles.Â There has not been a public show of support for Barr. Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News it is â€œtruly bizarre hill to die onâ€ for â€œGuardians of the Galaxyâ€ stars because of the inconsistency in reactions regarding Gunn and Barr. â€œThe same liberals who demanded Roseanneâ€™s head on a stake for a single tweet and who have sought to punish conservatives everywhere, now suddenly are worried about Gunn being fired for hundreds of vile tweets. Claiming they were all â€˜jokesâ€™. Going forward the left needs to decide if words matter or not,â€ Barron said. If Gunn is eventually brought back to Disney, political comedian Tim Young thinks it would indicate a clear double standard as Barr was fired by the same company for an offensive tweet that was deemed racist, and her cast mates are creating a spinoff that doesnâ€™t include the embattled actress. â€œI would hope that [the Gunn situation] shows a change and that people realize that ending someone&aposs career for not being politically correct or dropping a bad joke is the wrong thing to do,â€ Young told Fox News. Disney did not immediately respond when asked if it would consider rehiring Gunn.  
      The colleagues of â€œGuardians of the Galaxyâ€ director James Gunn want Disney to reinstate him despite a history of offensive tweets.
       Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro noted Gunn&aposs old messages were terrible but â€œnobody has surfaced any serious allegations that Gunn is actually a pedophileâ€ despite his lewd comments. Shapiro said nobody&aposs career should be ruined over past tweets. However, Shapiro doesnâ€™t think the situation would be playing out the same way if Gunn didnâ€™t have liberal political views. â€œEvery Hollywood cause is generally complete with calls for boycotts and career-targeting for those who are politically disapproved,â€ Shapiro  wrote . â€œHollywood is rife with discrimination against conservativesâ€¦ and members of the Hollywood community havenâ€™t been shy about excising those who donâ€™t agree with them on cultural grounds.â€ The statement from Gunn&aposs castmates highlighted the lack of due process Gunn received before his firing, noting that the political atmosphere in America has brought the world down a unique rabbit hole of sensitivity to past remarks. â€œWe are not here to defend his jokes of many years ago but rather to share our experience having spent many years together on set making â€˜Guardians of the Galaxyâ€™ 1 and 2,â€ the letter signed by â€œGuardian of the Galaxyâ€ stars stated. â€œThe character he has shown in the wake of his firing is consistent with the man he was every day on set, and his apology, now and from years ago when first addressing these remarks, we believe is from the heart, a heart we all know, trust and love.â€ Gunn&aposs past tweets were  dug up last week  by critics who oppose his political beliefs and discovered his feed was a treasure trove of offensive remarks regarding sex with minors, rape, jokes about the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, AIDS and the holocaust. One of the now-deleted tweets said, â€œI like when little boys touch me in my silly place.â€ Another message read: â€œThe best thing about being raped is when youâ€™re done being raped and itâ€™s like â€˜whew this feels great, not being raped!&aposâ€ GunnÂ apologized for the tweets from 2008-2011. â€œI have regretted them for many years sinceÂ â€” not just because they were stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive, and certainly not provocativeÂ like I had hoped, but also because they don&apost reflect the person I am today or have been for some time,â€ Gunn said in a statement. ""Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then."" Roseanne Barr likened President Obama&aposs African-American aide Valerie Jarret to a character from ""Planet of the Apes"" in a late-night tweet. She apologized and called her jokeÂ ""egregious and unforgivable"" and claimed she begged ABC to let her go on an apology tour to explainÂ her Jarrett comment. ""Instead what happened was about 40 minutes after that my show was canceled before even one advertiser pulled out and I was labeled a racist. Why, you ask? Well, the answer is simple.

In the 1942 classic film â€œCasablanca,â€ Captain Renault â€“ who was quite aware that nightclub owner Rick Blaine was operating a casino â€“ says in in mock surprise: â€œI&aposm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!â€ This should be our sarcastic response to news reports that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is continuing both his missile and nuclear programs, despite agreeing at a summit with President Trump in June in Singapore to â€œwork towardâ€ the â€œdenuclearizationâ€ of the Korean Peninsula. There were no specific actions attached to that vague pledge. You donâ€™t need a Ph.D. in foreign relations to figure out North Koreaâ€™s long-term strategy or intentions. In fact, despite Kimâ€™s smiles and handshakes when he met with President Trump, the North Koreans  love to tell us what they are going to do  before they do it. Unfortunately, American presidents, members of Congress and top policymakers â€“ both Democrats and Republicans â€“ havenâ€™t been listening most of the time, going back to the end of the Korean War in 1953. So I wasnâ€™t shocked at all at the story in The Washington Post. Kim told us what he was going to do in his  New Yearâ€™s Address on Jan. 1. Kim,  wearing  an ill-fitting gangster-style suit, declared: â€œThe nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, the power and reliability of which have already been proved to the full, to give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.â€ The dictator added: â€œAnd we should always be ready for immediate nuclear counterattack to cope with the enemy&aposs maneuvers for a nuclear war.â€ While I donâ€™t want to sound like an apologist for the brutal and murderous Kim regime, the facts are clear: Kim never agreed to any sort of missile or nuclear production freeze before, during or after his summit with President Trump. Kim did declare that he would not test ICBMs or nuclear weapons â€“ all positive steps. However, that still leaves his regime space to continue testing, refining and building more advanced missiles and nuclear bombs. This is what nuclear powers do â€“ so we should not be shocked. Concerned, yes. Shocked, no. The question now that the Trump administration needs to wrestle with is simple. What should be the U.S. response? Some on Team Trump â€“ likely including the president himself â€“ will to want to immediately react in some way to respond to The Washington Post story. But that would be the wrong approach. This is not the time for snap reactions or  Twitter attacks . Iâ€™m sure that the president and many in the administration are not keen to see  report  after  report  showing how North Koreaâ€™s nuclear weapons and missile programs are getting stronger, despite the Trump-Kim summit. Both President Trump and his predecessors have tried mightily to convince the North Koreans that nuclear weapons and missiles actually undermine â€“ not enhance â€“ their security. But Kim clearly sees his nukes as the ultimate insurance policy against a U.S. invasion that could topple his regime and result in his death. The Trump administration should continue, as  I have said  Â on several occasions, to press the Kim regime on its intentions, to see if it is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons and missiles. Kim Jong Un â€“ like his father and grandfather who ruled before him â€“ has consistently demanded a peace treaty or declaration that formally ends the Korean War, which halted in 1953 with an armistice. If the Trump administration is looking for a freeze on the Northâ€™s nuclear weapons and missile production, there may be a deal to be had. Hereâ€™s a realistic offer Kim might actually accept: President Trump and U.S. allies should offer to sign a declaration of peace ending the Korean War in exchange for Kim agreeing to permanently freeze North Koreaâ€™s missile and nuclear programs. And this would, of course, have to be verified by international inspectors on the ground. An international inspection team would need to be permanently stationed in the North. Such a move, which would see both sides make some tough concessions, should answer the question of whether Pyongyang is serious about doing anything to slow its growing nuclear capability. If the North will not even agree to this, then we have a pretty good idea that there is nothing we can do to get Kim to give up his weapons. However, if North Korea does agree â€“ and suitable language can be crafted on a peace declaration and a commitment on a nuclear and missile freeze â€“ there is the possibility that we could see some real progress happen. Building on a peace declaration, North and South Korea could work with the U.S. on non-nuclear arms control agreements. For example, why not some sort of cut of forces along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that both sides would inspect, which would be a good way to build trust? The size of the cut could be small â€“ say North Korea agrees to remove 500 artillery pieces from the DMZ, with South Korea making an equal cut in capabilities of artillery tubes. This could go on for several rounds over several months or years. Momentum, if all this happens â€“ which I will admit, is a long-shot â€“ could keep building. North Korea would need to then declare the size of its nuclear and missile programs. If it does that, negotiations can begin on a timeline and terms for the North to eventually give up these weapons. I would even offer to Kim a second summit if a deal that both sides can live with on denuclearization could be signed by the U.S. and North Korean leaders. Unfortunately for the entire planet, there is one thing you can count on: North Korean leaders have never kept their word on any of their nuclear promises going back decades. Kim Jong Un is a proven liar. The most likely scenario would be that Kim promises to stop nuclear weapons production, pockets the peace declaration, and then strings Team Trump along for months or years. We need to be mindful of this and be on the lookout for a North Korean trap. And if the Kim regime does revert to its old ways, the Trump administration will quickly need to craft a new strategy â€“ and  all the options are quite bad .",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kim-vs-trump-north-koreas-leaders-have-never-kept-their-word-on-nukes-heres-what-the-us-should-do-now,OPINION,Fox News,

President Trump gave hearty endorsements to Florida Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis Tuesday as two of the state&aposs top Republican elected officials seek higher office in November&aposs midterm elections. ""I don&apost do these endorsements easily,"" Trump told an enthusiastic crowd during his rally at Tampa&aposs Florida State Fairgrounds. ""I don&apost need to be here, but I happen to love this state."" The rally took place with four weeks to go before the Aug. 28 Republican gubernatorial primary, in which DeSantis will face off against state Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam. Trump touted the congressman as ""a true leader"", ""a proud veteran"", ""my great friend"" and predicted: ""he&aposs going to be your next governor."" ""I appreciate your support, Mr. President,"" DeSantis said after Trump called him up on stage. ""But I appreciate more the leadership you&aposre showing for our great country."" Trump also implored supporters to back Scott against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who he said was ""[Chuck] Schumer-controlled, [and] Nancy Pelosi-controlled,"" referring to the Senate and House Democratic leaders. Video ""You know, I live a lot of time in Florida,"" Trump said. ""The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election. And after a while, you forget: &aposWho&aposs the senator?&apos But around five months, you see him at parties and you see him around ... We have to make sure that Rick Scott wins and wins big."" The speech was notable for Trump&aposs emphatic call to implement stricter voter ID requirements in apparent response toÂ  some cities Â giving illegal immigrants the right to vote inÂ  certain elections . ""Only American citizens should vote in American elections,"" Trump said. ""Which is why the time has come for voter ID, like everything else. ""You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card."" Trump claimed. ""You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture."" ""In this country, the only time you donâ€™t need it, in many cases, is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman. Itâ€™s crazy."" Video Trump also publicly pondered the idea of talking to Iran&aposs leaders, one day after saying he&aposd meet them without preconditions. ""I hope it works out well with Iran. Theyâ€™re having a lot of difficulty right now,"" he said in an aside. ""I hope it works out well. And I have a feeling theyâ€™ll be talking to us pretty soon. And maybe not, and thatâ€™s OK, too."" The Florida gubernatorial contest is the latest GOP primary into which Trump has injected himself, having previously helped candidates in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina with endorsements that have helped set the stage for the fall elections. RON DESANTIS TEACHES HIS KIDS ABOUT TRUMP IN CAMPAIGN AD Last month, Trump endorsed DeSantis, saying that he would be ""strong on borders, tough on crime [and] big on cutting taxes."" Florida represented a crucial triumph for Trump in the 2016 presidential election and the president has maintained a steady presence in the state, returning frequently to his winter home in Palm Beach. ""We are restoring American strength and American pride,"" Trump said. ""But to continue this incredible momentum, this incredible movement ... we need to elect more Republicans. We need more votes."" Appearing at a technical school in Tampa earlier Tuesday, Trump praised the strength of the economy, telling students and faculty members there was never a better time to learn new skills and gain employment. He was joined by Scott, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump and several members of Congress from Florida. DeSantis has tied his campaign for governor directly to Trump, even teaching one of his two children to ""build the wall"" with blocks in a recent campaign ad. Putnam, a former congressman, has run a more traditional campaign for governor, barnstorming the state with campaign events aimed at building upon his family&aposs deep ties to the state.

           (AP/Getty) President Trump blasted the conservative mega-donor Koch brothers on Tuesday as a â€œtotal jokeâ€ and promised supporters he would be â€œa puppet for no one,â€ amid rising tensions over trade and other administration policies. â€œThe globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I donâ€™t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œI made them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, Iâ€™m for America First & American Worker -- a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!â€ The presidentâ€™s tweets come after the advocacy network created by billionaires Charles and David Koch announced they would not support Republican Senate candidate for North Dakota, Kevin Cramer. The Koch brothers also did not endorse Trump in the 2016 presidential election. A spokesman for the Koch Network responded to the president&aposs criticisms later Monday morning. ""We support policies that help all people improve their lives,"" spokesman for the Koch Network James Davis said in a statement to Fox News. ""We look forward to working with anyone to do so."" The Washington Post  reported that at a reception held by the Koch network over the weekend, officials revealed a new approach â€”distancing themselves from the GOP and becoming less focused on partisan politics. Charles Koch said he â€œregretsâ€ support for some Republican lawmakers in recent years. â€œWeâ€™re going to be more strict on holding someone accountable if they say theyâ€™re going to be for the principles that we espouse, and then they arenâ€™t,â€ Charles Koch said, according to the Washington Post. â€œOur organization is happy to support anybody. Weâ€™d love for there to be more Democrats to support these ideas and these issues.â€ The Koch brothers have been highly critical of Republicans in recent months, slamming the GOP for not doing enough to curb government spending in their $1.3 trillion spending bill adopted in March. They have specifically criticized the White House over Trumpâ€™s â€œprotectionistâ€ trade policies, which they fear could trigger a U.S. recession in addition to a looming international trade war. Trumpâ€™s policies also have not always been in line with the Kochs&apos political group â€” Americans for Prosperity. But the group says it still plans to focus resources and funds to help Republican Senate candidates in Tennessee, Florida and Wisconsin. According to  Forbes,  each Koch brother is worth approximately $60 billion, tying for 8th richest person in the world.

President Trump has asked John Kelly to stay on as White House chief of staff through 2020, multiple sources told Fox News on Tuesday. The move comes as Kelly marked one year at the White House -- an anniversary that prompted inevitable speculation about whether he will stay or go. The Associated Press reports that Kelly has told staffers he has agreed to stay on. Kelly was brought on in July 2017 to impose order on a chaotic West Wing, replacing Reince Priebus. The former Homeland Security secretary and Marine Corps general made swift changes in both personnel and protocol, limiting the once-freewheeling environment surrounding the president. But his standing in the White House has been somewhat diminished in recent months.

31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Adam Shaw,Trump takes aim at 3D-printed guns: 'Doesn't seem to make much sense',"close Video States sue to block online blueprints for 3D-printed guns 8 states file suit against the Trump administration over its decision to allow Defense Distributed to publish downloadable blueprints for guns; Anita Vogel reports on the case. President Trump on Tuesday voiced concern about 3D-printed guns being available to the public, saying he has talked to the National Rifle Association and it â€œdoesnâ€™t seem to make much sense.â€ ""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesnâ€™t seem to make much sense!"" he tweeted. On Monday, eight states filed suit against the administration over its decision to allow Defense Distributed to publish downloadable blueprints for guns online. The suit argues that the weapons assist terrorists and criminals, and essentially nullify state gun control laws. Separately, Democratic attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back from the settlement. 3D-PRINTED GUN BLUEPRINTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED, ENDING LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLEÂ  The founder of the Texas-based company first published designs for a 3D-printed gun in 2013, which was subsequently downloaded approximately 100,000 times until he was ordered to stop by the State Department. The June settlement allows the company to resume posting the blueprints. The company meanwhile, filed its own suit on Sunday, claiming it is the victim of an ""ideologically-fueled program of intimidation and harassment"" that violates the company&aposs First Amendment rights. Founder Cody Wilson told  The Washington Post  that the controversy is not about gun regulation and safety risks: â€œItâ€™s about access to information.â€ According to the Post, the Trump administration rejected the First Amendment argument as early as April, noting that the files direct the functioning of a 3D printer and cause it to create firearms. But the settlement nevertheless allows the blueprints to be circulated.Â Â  The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence slammed the move Â as â€œreckless and stupid.â€ â€œDuring the Obama years, the government thought that 3D printed guns posed a serious threat to national security. I&aposm not aware of anything that has changed except who sits in the White House,â€ Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News in an emailed statement last month. â€œUntraceable and undetectable guns that bypass our bipartisan background check system put us all at risk. The country deserves answers from the Trump Administration about why it thinks this is a good idea. Making it easier for dangerous people to get guns is reckless and stupid, and this is going to make Americans less safe."" Meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that the department has ""completed the actions that were required under the settlement agreement in the Defense Distributed litigation."" Trumpâ€™s tweet appears to complicate the matter somewhat, but Democrats didnâ€™t seem appreciative of the support. â€œYour administration approved this.

31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Robert Charles,"Most Americans agree with Trump, not Cohen â€“ Taping clients 'smacks of trickery'","close Video Media furor over Cohen tape Trump discussed possible payment to Playboy model. There is something surreal about the endless twists and turns surrounding Michael Cohen, one of President Trumpâ€™s former personal attorneys. Even an informed observer is challenged trying to understand Cohenâ€™s quixotic legal practices, never mind his sprawling business pursuits. Last week we learned that Cohen secretly recorded conversations with clients, including private citizen Donald Trump. No wonder the president asked, on learning of this: â€œWhat kind of lawyer would tape his client?â€ It is a good question. Most Americans would ask the same question. Whatever Cohenâ€™s future, his past is odd. In addition to being citizen Trumpâ€™s attorney, Cohen is the target of an apparently unrelated FBI public corruption investigation and has reportedly been the recipient of foreign payments for putative political purposes, an alleged go-between for people trying to influence Trump, the owner of New York taxi medallions and a tax debtor. Putting aside the spider web of Cohenâ€™s alleged legal, business and political affairs, how about that question: â€œWhat kind of lawyer would tape his client?â€ New York Penal Law, Section 250, technically permits recording a telephone conversation if one party consents. However, 12 states â€“ including neighboring Connecticut â€“ do not permit such recordings unless both parties consent.  New York courts have long frowned on attorneys blithely recording their clients without consent. In the early 1990s, they described the practice as ethically â€œunderhandedâ€ and â€œdeceptive.â€ That view goes back to rulings in the 1960s and American Bar Association (ABA) positions. The New York County Bar Association is more permissive, but the ABA notes that non-consensual recording remains unethical when the recording â€œis accompanied by other circumstances that make it unethical,â€ such as an attorney representing he did not record a conversation. In all events, the ABA terms the practice professionally â€œinadvisable.â€ Thatâ€™s a safe position. In 2003, the New York City Bar was more direct, vigorously defending client privacy. The organization found secret recording â€œsmacks of trickery,â€ which strikes average Americans as rather obvious. It said using non-consensual recording as a â€œroutine practiceâ€ is â€œethically impermissibleâ€ for any lawyer, carving out a narrow exception for â€œsocietal goodâ€ â€“ an undefined term. So, what is prevailing authority regarding what Cohen did to Trump?Â  Practitioners consider the New York City Barâ€™s view the prevailing authority. At best for Cohen, the law is indeterminate, confused and contradictory. At worst, his habit of recording clients â€“ using the language of the New York City Bar â€“â€œsmacks of trickery.â€ Recent case law seems to side with President Trump. A 2015 case involving unauthorized videotaping produced a strong judicial condemnation. There, the court rejected a broad definition of â€œsocietal good,â€ saying secret recordings â€œcannot be regarded as an â€˜appropriate toolâ€™ or an activity that attorneys should feel free to engage in â€˜all the time.â€™â€ Likewise, although facts differ, surreptitious taping was at issue in a 2014 case, where another New York court rejected it, noting the even an attorneyâ€™s false claim to have taped was objectionable. Had the counsel done so, she would â€œlikely have violatedâ€ rules forbidding â€œdishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,â€ the court found. In the end, the law only offers a partial answer to President Trumpâ€™s question. Allowing for narrow exceptions, what kind of an attorney would mislead his client into thinking he was  not  being recorded? What kind of attorney would put his client in a position where basic client trust was at risk, where attorney-client privilege was put in jeopardy, and where tape recordings were made of privileged conversations, subsequently susceptible to full public release?Â  Is this not the antithesis of the revered attorney-client relationship? Putting politics aside, the president seems to have a good point. Average Americans can relate. Ask yourself: Wouldnâ€™t you be outraged to learn a lawyer you were paying to represent you was surreptitiously recording your every word? Who would not be outraged at what the New York City Bar says â€œsmacks of trickeryâ€â€“ and then finding these privileged conversations in the public domain?Â  Whatever counterarguments, most Americans will likely side with the President Trump. Attorneys should not blithely tape clients, period.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/most-americans-agree-with-trump-not-cohen-taping-clients-smacks-of-trickery,OPINION,Fox News,
31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Associated Press,Iran: Trump needs to rejoin nuclear deal if he wants talks,"TEHRAN, Iran â€“  Iranian officials reacted skeptically on Tuesday to President Donald Trump&aposs comments that he&aposs willing to negotiate with his Iranian counterpart, saying instead that if Trump wants talks, he needs to rejoin the international nuclear deal he unilaterally pulled out of earlier this year. Trump on Monday said he&aposd meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ""anytime"" if the Iranian leader were willing. In his first public remarks after the comment, Rouhani did not mention Trump at all but instead stressed the need for the other nations involved in the nuclear deal to forge ahead with their pledges of trying to salvage it. ""Today we are at a very critical point in history regarding the nuclear deal, and Europe&aposs transparent measures to compensate for the United States&apos unlawful withdrawal from it are very important for the Iranian nation,"" Rouhani said after talks with new British Ambassador Rob Macaire. In addition to Britain, China, Germany, France, Russia and the European Union are negotiating with Iran on preserving the deal. The Iranian leadership has previously ruled out one-on-one talks with Trump, following his decision to pull the United States out of the deal under which Iran was given relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Iran&aposs semi-official ISNA news agency quoted political adviser Hamid Aboutalebi as saying that for talks to happen, the U.S. needs to rejoin the deal. ""Those who believe in dialogue as a method of resolving disputes in civilized societies should be committed to the means,"" he said. Trump withdrew from the landmark nuclear accord in May, saying it was too generous to Iran. He has vowed to ramp up sanctions until Iran radically changes its regional policies, including its support for regional militant groups, something the country&aposs leaders have long refused to do. Even though Trump on Monday said if Rouhani were to meet with him there would be ""no preconditions,"" he also did not walk back from any of those earlier demands. With the first U.S. sanctions due to come into effect next Monday, the economy in Iran has already been hit, giving rise to growing fears of prolonged economic suffering. Another round, covering other types of commerce, including oil purchases, goes into effect Nov. 4. Rouhani on Tuesday again suggested Iran could cause major disruptions in the Gulf region by attempting to block key shipping lanes, saying ""Iran has never sought tensions in the region and does not want there to be any problem for the world&aposs waterways, but it will never let go of its right to export oil,"" the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. With the U.S. sanctions looming, the Iranian currency has been in freefall, hitting a new low Monday, at 122,000 rial to the dollar on the thriving black market. It recovered slightly to 115,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, and concerns are growing as Iranians have seen their savings dwindle and purchasing power drop. Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the head of influentialÂ parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, suggested a U.S. return to the nuclear deal, which would bring an end to the economic uncertainty, would be needed before Tehran could think of negotiating. ""There can be no negotiations with the Americans raising the issue of talks from the position of power,"" he was quoted as saying on the website of the Iranian parliament, calling Trump&aposs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal the ""biggest blow to diplomacy.""  Reformist lawmaker Mostafa Kavakebian questioned negotiating with Trump, calling him ""untrustworthy,"" and also said now was not the time for talks. ""If this negotiation (is) carried out in any form, then it will be considered as surrender and the Iranian nation will not surrender,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/iran-trump-needs-to-rejoin-nuclear-deal-if-he-wants-talks,MILITARY,Fox News,

OfficialsÂ on Sunday ordered evacuations around twin fires in Mendocino and Lake counties, including from the 4,700-resident town of Lakeport, a popular destination for bass anglers and boaters on the shores of Clear Lake, about 120 miles north of San Francisco. The blazes have destroyed seven homes and threaten 10,000 others. So far, the flames have blackened more than 68,000 acres â€” well over 100 square miles â€” with minimal containment. Those fires were among 17 burning across the state, where fire crews were stretched to the limit.Â  Farther north, the wildfire in Redding, Calif. blaze is now believed to be the ninth most destructive in state history, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.Â The blaze, which killed two firefighters and four civilians including two children, has now destroyed 818 homes and 311 outbuildings and damaged 165 homes, McLean said.Â More than 27,000 people remained evacuated from their homes although another 10,000 were allowed to return Monday as fire crews reinforced lines on the western end of the blaze.

31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Associated Press,"Threats aside, Trump says he's willing to meet with Iranians","WASHINGTON â€“  President Donald Trump said that he&aposd ""certainly meet"" with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and without preconditions, if the Iranian leader were willing. Speaking Monday during a joint news conference with Italy&aposs premier, Trump said he would meet with the Iranians ""anytime they want to."" ""I&aposll meet with anybody,"" he said. ""There&aposs nothing wrong with meeting."" The overture comes as Trump and the Iranians have been escalating their rhetoric after Trump&aposs May withdrawal from the landmark nuclear accord. The United States has also vowed to boost sanctions until Iran changes its regional policies, including its support for regional militant groups. The first of those sanctions are to go into effect Monday. Iranian officials reacted skeptically on Tuesday. Iran&aposs semi-official ISNA news agency quoted political adviser Hamid Aboutalebi as saying that for talks to happen, the U.S. needs to rejoin the nuclear deal. It&aposs unclear whether Rouhani has any interest in meeting with Trump. Rouhani&aposs chief of staff claimed earlier this month in Iran&aposs state-owned newspaper that Rouhani had rejected eight requests from Trump for one-on-one talks last year. Rouhani recently warned the U.S. that ""war with Iran is the mother of all wars,"" prompting an all-caps retort from Trump. ""To Iranian President Rouhani,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH."" He ended the message with a warning: ""BE CAUTIOUS!"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif fired back with his own message that began, ""COLOR US UNIMPRESSED."" Trump tempered his threatening rhetoric two days later when he said his administration stands ready for Iran to come back to the negotiating table. ""We&aposre ready to make a real deal, not the deal that was done by the previous administration, which was a disaster,"" he said. Trump has long cast himself as a master negotiator who is most effective when he meets with his counterparts face-to-face. He pointed to his recent one-on-ones with North Korea&aposs Kim Jong Un and Russia&aposs Vladimir Putin as examples of the benefits of such get-togethers. ""I believe in meeting,"" he said, talking up the benefits of ""speaking to other people, especially when you&aposre talking about potentials of war and death and famine and lots of other things."" Asked whether he would set any preconditions for the meetings, Trump was clear. ""No preconditions, no. If they want to meet, I&aposll meet anytime they want, anytime they want,"" he said. ""Good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I&aposll meet."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC on Monday that he was onboard with the president&aposs invitation, saying Trump ""wants to meet with folks to solve problems."" But he appeared to add several qualifications: ""If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their maligned behavior, can agree that it&aposs worthwhile to enter in a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he&aposs prepared to sit down and have a conversation with him."" Early reaction on Capitol Hill was mixed, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who is often critical of Trump, telling reporters: ""I actually think that&aposs a good idea."" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., characterized the overture as ""fine,"" but only ""as long as they are willing to talk about being a normal country in the future."" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a frequent Trump critic, was more skeptical, calling it ""another recipe for bad outcomes."" ""It&aposs the same as North Korea,"" he said. ""No preconditions, no preparation. And what do we have? We have Kim Jong Un was elevated from an international pariah to someone who seems like a legitimate statesman."" ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Alan Fram contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/threats-aside-trump-says-hes-willing-to-meet-with-iranians,MILITARY,Fox News,
31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Brooke Singman,Painting of Trump team 'Crossing the Swamp' touches off social media frenzy,"
          Jon McNaughton's ""Crossing the Swamp"" is a riff on the classic ""Washington Crossing the Delaware,"" but replacing George Washington's crew with members of President Trump's administration.
           (Jon McNaughton, jonmcnaughton.com) Maybe it&aposs John Bolton clutching a gun. Maybe it&aposs Mike Pompeo setting down his binoculars to stare into the distance. Maybe it&aposs the gators. But a newly unveiled painting meant to depict President Trump and his team navigating the Washington ""swamp"" has something for everyone. Utah-based artist Jon McNaughton touched off a social media frenzy as he shared his painting, â€œCrossing the Swamp,â€ Tuesday on Twitter. The painting is a riff on the classic â€œWashington Crossing the Delaware,â€ only it replaces George Washington&aposs crew with members of the Trump administration. â€œMy new paintingâ€”â€˜Crossing the Swampâ€™ â€˜Never give up. Never lower your light. Never stop till the swamp is dry,â€™â€ McNaughton tweeted. The painting shows Trump at the helm, and Vice President Pence carrying the flag by his side. McNaughton identifies the rest as: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; first lady Melania Trump; Secretary of State Pompeo; White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders; the presidentâ€™s daughter Ivanka Trump; National Security Adviser Bolton; Kellyanne Conway; and Chief of Staff John Kelly. McNaughton is a Trump supporter, hashtagging â€œMAGAâ€ on his Twitter bio. â€œTrump endeavors to cross the â€˜swampâ€™ of Washington DC as he carries the light of truth, hope, and prosperity. The murky water of the deep state is laced with dangerous vermin, perfectly willing to destroy American prosperity for their personal ideologies and financial gain,â€ McNaughton said of his latest painting on his  website. McNaughton also  wrote  that he hopes people will â€œstudy the paintings and try to understand the deeper meaning.â€ No matter how earnest the artist&aposs intentions, the painting quickly became Twitter fodder as users seized on a variety of quirky aspects. Observations included: ""Ben Carson appears to be rowing backwards."" ""They are literally rowing in a circle."" ""Pretty sure Pruitt took the cruise line route."" ""Looks like Jr. didnâ€™t make the boat."" Twitter can be cruel. McNaughton has several other paintings on his website about the Trump administration. One, titled â€œMake America Safe,â€ depicts Trump standing in front of a white picket fence with an open lock, holding a key, and the American flag waving in the background. Another, titled â€œRespect the Flag,â€ shows Trump on a football field, hugging a ripped flag, seemingly referencing the presidentâ€™s battle with the National Football League over players kneeling during the National Anthem.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/painting-of-trump-team-crossing-the-swamp-touches-off-social-media-frenzy,White House,Fox News,
31/07/2018,2018,7,31,Kaitlyn Schallhorn,Trump aide Marc Short's hiring at University of Virginia prompts professors' resignation,"
          Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, is leaving the Trump administration and will take a position as senior fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs. Members of the UVA community, including faculty and students, have signed onto petitions asking the school to rescind the offer.
           (Reuters) Two University of Virginia history professors have resigned from the schoolâ€™s Miller Center for Public Affairs after it hired Marc Short, a former Trump aide. Professors William I. Hitchcock and Melvyn P. Leffler said the hiring of Short, who was the White House director of legislative and intergovernmental affairs, violated the Miller Centerâ€™s values â€œto hire such a notoriously partisan political appointee as a paid distinguished fellow,â€ especially without input from faculty. â€œYour decision was made without adequate faculty discussion, deliberation, and a vote. TheÂ practice of faculty governance did not prevail,â€ Hitchcock and Leffler said in their  resignation letter . Hitchcock and Leffler will continue to be tenured faculty at the university, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The  school announced  the hiring of Short as a senior fellow earlier this month and was  immediately met with opposition . After the news, 150 UVA faculty and students signed a petition calling for the university to revoke the hiring of Short. AnÂ  identical Change.org petition Â has also garnered more than 3,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. â€œWhile we do not object to dialogue with members of this administration, we do object to the use of our university to clean up their tarnished reputations,â€Â  the petition read . â€œNo one should be serving at the highest levels of this administration, daily supporting and defending its actions one week, then representing UVA the next.â€ Leffler and Hitchcock were among those who signed the petition. MARC SHORTâ€™S HIRING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA PROTESTED BY FACULTY, STUDENTS Faculty and students also criticized Trumpâ€™s handling of the aftermath of a white nationalist demonstration inÂ Charlottesville that turned deadly when a manÂ  rammed his car Â through a group of people protesting the white supremacists,Â  killing one woman . TrumpÂ  initially blamed Â the violence â€œon many sides,â€ but two days later, he disavowed racists while speaking from the White House. He later returned to blaming â€œboth sidesâ€ for the deadly attack, however. ""It is unconscionable that we would add to our university a person who served in a high-level position for the administration that first empowered, then defended, those white nationalists,"" the petition states. â€œWe are a community still in the process of healing, and someone who defended the presidentâ€™s remarks after the violence here is a barrier to that process, a source of trauma in a still-traumatized community,â€ the petition continued. FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS: A LIST OF NOTABLE DEPARTURES ShortÂ  told Politico Â he is â€œsympathetic to the pain in the community.â€ â€œI think we could have done a better job expressing sympathy for the victims and outrage at those who perpetrated this evil,â€ he said. The two history professors  told the Chronicle of Higher Education  that they believe Short should be able to speak at the center but objected to his hiring. A spokesman for the Miller Center said it was â€œcommitted to nonpartisan and bipartisan study of the president.â€ â€œThe addition of Marc Short, a senior Trump Administration official with intimate knowledge of interactions between the White House and Congress, deepens our scholarly inquiries into the workings of the American presidency,â€ Howard Witt, director of communications for the Miller Center, previously told Fox News. â€œAnd his presence reinforces our commitment to nonpartisan and bipartisan dialogue among scholars and practitioners of good will who may nevertheless hold strongly opposing personal political viewpoints.â€ â€œMoreover, Short can offer insights into the Trump Administration that are not currently available to our scholars or the public at large,â€ Witt added. Shortâ€™s last day at the White House was July 20. He is supposed to begin at the university in August.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-aide-marc-shorts-hiring-at-university-of-virginia-prompts-professors-resignation,White House,Fox News,
01/08/2018,2018,8,1,Samuel Chamberlain,Mueller responds to Trump attorneys' request for parameters of potential interview,"close Video Mueller responds to Trump lawyers' interview requests Special counsel Robert Mueller answers Trump lawyers' requests regarding a potential interview as Trump says Sessions should stop the Russia investigation; John Roberts reports.
 Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finally responded to a letter from President Trump&aposs outside attorneys about what the scope and format of a potential interview with the president would be, sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News on Wednesday. The sources said Mueller has agreed to cut the number of questions for Trump from an initial list of 49 and is willing to have some questions answered in writing â€“ though he wants other questions answered orally. However, the sources added that Mueller has not agreed to the president&aposs demands to limit his questioning to matters related to allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The special prosecutor still wants to ask the president about obstruction of justice and other topics. The sources also said talks with the special counsel about a possible interview are continuing, but as one source said: ""There is still a long way to go."" While the Trump legal team&aposs current posture is still not to have the president sit for an interview with Mueller, a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News, â€œnever say never.â€ Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, speaking to reporters following an appearance at a Republican congressional campaign event in New Hampshire, said the president&aposs legal team had received ""a letter back"" from the special counsel&aposs team on Tuesday and ""now we&aposre in the process of responding to their proposal."" ""I&aposm not going to give you a lot of hope it&aposs going to happen,"" Giuliani said of a potential Trump-Mueller sitdown, ""but we&aposre still negotiating."" On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop Mueller&aposs ""Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further."" Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation last year, handing off that responsibility to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump has asserted previously that Mueller has too many conflicts of interest for him to fairly lead the investigation, citing his ties to fired former FBI Director James Comey as well as what the president called a ""very nasty & contentious business relationship"" in a tweet earlier this week. Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday that Trump&aposs Sessions tweet amounted to obstruction of justice. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the message represented ""the president&aposs opinion"" and not an order to the Justice Department. ""If he wanted to obstruct [the investigation], he&aposd obstruct it, just end it,"" Giuliani said of Trump in New Hampshire. ""Then you&aposd all battle whether he has the legal right to do that, which I think he does. But he&aposs not going to do that. He&aposs made it clear he wants it to run its course.""

01/08/2018,2018,8,1,Howard Kurtz,Critics say Trump doesn't care about losing the House. Really?,"close Video Kurtz: WSJ: Speaker Pelosi would help Trump win 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the Wall Street Journal editorial published claiming that President Trump may be creating a strategy to purposefully lose the House in the midterm elections. President Trump makes so much news that I could write a half-dozen columns today just on his latest comments and tweetsâ€”any one of which would lead the news in ordinary times. Trump says he&aposs willing to meet with the leader of Iran, despite having abandoned the nuclear deal. I&aposll put that in the category of Not Happening, not least because the Iranians (unlike Kim Jong-un) say they have no interest in sitting down with the president who&aposs squeezing their country with economic sanctions. Trump says the Koch brothers and their network are a ""total joke"" and ""globalist"" and ""highly overrated."" This is a response to criticism from Charles Koch and some of his donors that the presidentâ€™s rhetoric is divisive and they donâ€™t back him on tariffs and immigration. But the Kochs were never big Trump fans and didnâ€™t endorse him. Trump tweeted yesterday that ""the Fake News Media is going CRAZY! They are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, I enjoy watching."" ""Crazy"" and ""unhinged"" are very strong words, but the president pretty much goes off on the press every day now. I was not terribly excited when Trump said he would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats don&apost give him funding for border security, including the wall. I view this as a negotiating tactic to pressure the other party on a hot-button issue in the midterms. After all, the last government shutdown lasted, what, a few hours? But it led to a fascinating Wall Street Journal editorial yesterday that questioned whether Trump really cares if Republicans lose the House in November. The brinkmanship, favored by Steve Bannon, might hurt red-state Senate Democrats, but could boomerang in the House, the Journal says. The editorial argues that the president ""might not fear"" a Democratic House as long as the GOP keeps the Senate: ""Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be from central political casting."" Sure, a Pelosi-run House ""would mean the end of most of Mr. Trump&aposs agenda."" But he could cut deals with House Democrats on paid family leave, public-works spending and trade protectionism. And here&aposs the zinger: Even if the House Dems move ahead with impeachment, says the Journal, there would never be a two-thirds Senate majority for conviction. And that could help Trump win reelection if Republicans and independents ""conclude he&aposs the only barrier to a left-wing government led by a President Elizabeth Warren."" There are plenty of political assumptions baked into this speculation, of course. But the Journal (owned by Rupert Murdoch) is very much running counter to such former Republicans as George Will and Steve Schmidt urging people to vote Democratic this fall to provide a check on a president they despise. It&aposs true that Bill Clinton thrived (and won reelection) after the Newt Gingrich Republicans captured the House in 1994. And it&aposs true that Trump is at odds with conservative House Republicans on a number of key issues. But in the end I don&apost believe that Trump is willing to lose the House in a Machiavellian scheme to propel himself to a second term. House Democrats, even if they&aposre smart enough to avoid impeachment, would make Trump&aposs life miserable with endless hearings, subpoenas and investigations. And they&aposd play to their base by blocking nearly everything he wants to do. The president will almost certainly avoid a government shutdown and try to save his House majority, because it would be even harder to win reelection after two years of getting nothing done.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-say-trump-doesnt-care-about-losing-the-house-really,Media Buzz,Fox News,
01/08/2018,2018,8,1,Judson Berger,Trump urges Attorney General Sessions to end Russia probe,"close Video Trump calls on Sessions to stop 'rigged' Mueller probe President Trump calls on his attorney general to end the Mueller investigation. John Roberts reports from the White House. President Trump called Wednesday for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s Russia investigation â€œright now,â€ alleging bias on the investigative team and complaining about the trial of his former campaign chairman. â€œThis is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œBob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!â€ The tweet renewed Democratic complaints that Trump is wrongly challenging the independence of the special counsel. Trump has repeatedly blasted the probe as a â€œwitch hunt,â€ but the call for Sessions to intervene represents another escalation. Sessions, however, already recused himself last year â€“ handing off oversight to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. So he is unlikely to act. A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the tweet when reached by Fox News. Another source familiar with the investigation downplayed the implications of the tweet â€“ as Trump previously has vented his frustration with both the Russia probe and Sessionsâ€™ recusal from it. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement: â€œWe have been saying for months that it is time to bring this inquiry to an end. The President has expressed the same opinion.â€ Trump afterward tweeted concerns about the trial of ex-campaign boss Paul Manafort, which entered its second day on Wednesday morning.  â€œPaul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didnâ€™t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!â€ he tweeted. Trump went on to target the anti-Trump dossier and former investigators who exchanged anti-Trump text messages. The president has previously tried to assert that Mueller is conflicted, based on a claim that he turned him down for FBI director, his ties to fired bureau boss James Comey and other issues. Trump has long complained about the presence of Democratic donors on the Mueller team. But Democratic lawmakers have warned Trump and his allies about encroaching on the Mueller probeâ€™s independence. In response to Wednesday&aposs tweet, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top intelligence committee Democrat, said, ""This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it."" After conservative House members unveiled a Rosenstein impeachment resolution, top House Democrats last week also noted that Mueller has already obtained over two-dozen indictments and said:  â€œ Any attempt to [take action against Mueller or Rosenstein] will be viewed by Congress and the American people as further proof of an effort to obstruct justice with severe consequences for Trump and his presidency.â€ As Trump issued his call, Manafortâ€™s trial, for tax and bank fraud charges unrelated to Russian meddling, was moving into full swing. His defense teamâ€™s opening day strategy was to try and undermine the Mueller teamâ€™s star witness, Rick Gates, who was Manafortâ€™s deputy in business and at the Trump campaign. The attorneys argued Gates was the one who transferred all the money into accounts, including consulting fees collected from Ukrainian political figures. They said he was embezzling money and later lied about it to investigators â€“ before agreeing to flip and testify against Manafort. But the Mueller team contends Manafort bankrolled a luxurious globe-trotting lifestyle with money he wasnâ€™t paying taxes on. Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye told the jury Tuesday that Manafort considered himself above the law as he funneled tens of millions of dollars through offshore accounts to pay for personal expenses such as a $21,000 watch and a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich. ""All of these charges boil down to one simple issue: that Paul Manafort lied,"" Asonye said. ""Manafort placed himself and his money over the law.""

01/08/2018,2018,8,1,Marc Thiessen,"Marc Thiessen: Trump, Putin, NATO and the Montenegro question","close Video Trump takes aim at Germany on Twitter during NATO summit President calls on country to pay more toward their protection from Russia; Greg Palkot reports from Brussels. Fox News host Tucker Carlson recently asked President Trump, ""Why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack?"" It is a fair question -- one that many Americans were asking following Trump&aposs performance at the NATO summit -- and it deserved a better answer than the president&aposs musing on the ""aggressive"" nature of Montenegrins. Instead, Trump should have recalled the words he spoke last year in Poland praising the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising, the 74th anniversary of which is being marked on Wednesday.  In one of the most powerful speeches of his presidency, Trump recalled the terrible price that millions paid for the West&aposs failure to deter Nazi and Soviet aggression. ""Under a double occupation, the Polish people endured evils beyond description,"" Trump recalled: ""the Katyn forest massacre, the occupations, the Holocaust, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the destruction of this beautiful capital city and the deaths of nearly 1 in 5 Polish people. A vibrant Jewish population -- the largest in Europe -- was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland&aposs Jewish citizens."" The reason NATO was created out of the ashes of World War II was precisely to make certain such destruction never happens again.  In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain famously dismissed Germany&aposs threats to Czechoslovakia, declaring that Britain should not get drawn into war ""because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing."" The result was 50 million people dead, a continent in flames and the gas chambers of Auschwitz. The lesson we learned from that experience is that weakness is provocative. When adversaries believe you are weak, they are emboldened to act -- and prone to miscalculate. When they believe you are strong and determined, however, they are far less likely to test you and start cataclysmic wars. Trump believes in peace through strength. But to have peace requires not just military strength. As Trump said in Warsaw, ""Our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will."" President Ronald Reagan used the military far less than any of those who succeeded him in office not just because he rebuilt America&aposs military strength but also because America&aposs adversaries did not doubt his willingness to use it. Why did Russian President Vladimir Putin believe he could invade Ukraine and annex Crimea without consequence? It was no mere coincidence that Russia&aposs intervention happened just six months after President Barack Obama failed to enforce his red line in Syria. Putin saw that Obama imposed no costs on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&aposs defiance, unwilling to launch strikes that a U.S. official said would be ""just muscular enough not to get mocked."" At that moment, he knew there would be no real costs for his intervention in Ukraine. Obama projected weakness. On taking office, Trump rectified that situation by enforcing Obama&aposs Syria red line, not once but twice -- sending a message of strength that was heard not just in Damascus but in Moscow as well. There is a reason Putin despises the NATO alliance so much -- and has fought to prevent further integration of the countries of Eastern Europe into it. He knows he may be able to bully his unallied neighbors, but he can&apost bully a NATO ally -- because that ally is backed up by 28 others, bonded by a mutual commitment to each other&aposs security and led by an American president who, while seeking friendship with all, is unafraid to flex U.S. military muscle. That is why Putin opposed the admission of Montenegro into the NATO alliance, reportedly even backing a plot to assassinate Montenegro&aposs prime minister in an effort to stop it.  That is why Putin wants Trump to fail in his effort to get the NATO allies to meet their commitments and spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. He understands that a weak NATO cannot deter him but a strong NATO can. As Trump said in Warsaw, ""As long as we know our history, we will know how to build our future. Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests.""  The whole point of NATO is not to defend Montenegro; it is to make sure we  never have to defend Montenegro  -- or Warsaw, or Paris, or London again.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marc-thiessen-trump-putin-nato-and-the-montenegro-question,OPINION,Fox News,

A U.S. appeals court ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to threaten to withhold funding from â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ that arenâ€™t cooperating with immigration officials. ""Absent congressional authorization, the administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals,""Â Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for the majority.

The judge said the president didnâ€™t have the authority to attach new conditions to spending approved by Congress, adding that the president&aposs efforts also violated the separation of power doctrines. The ruling came in lawsuits filed by two California counties â€” San Francisco and Santa Clara. A federal judge also ruled last Friday that the U.S. Justice Department cannot withhold grants from Chicago because it was providing sanctuary to immigrants. Trump promised to crack down on sanctuary cities, claiming they were â€œharboringâ€ illegal immigrants.

Mike Emanuel has the details for 'Special Report.' WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Wednesday gave final congressional approval to a $716 billion defense policy bill that would raise military pay by 2.6 percent, the largest pay hike in nine years. The 87-10 vote sends the bill to the White House for President Donald Trump&aposs expected signature. The compromise bill weakens a bid to clamp down on the Chinese telecom giant ZTE and allows the president to waive sanctions against countries that have bought Russian weapons but now want to buy U.S. military equipment. The bill does not fund Trump&aposs request for a new ""Space Force"" as an independent service branch but authorizes a military parade he wants in Washington in November. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had urged Senate passage, saying the bill supports Trump&aposs request for a pay raise for troops and ""rebuilds the military to deter adversaries and maintain the administration&aposs posture of peace through strength."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against the defense bill because of the decision to strip out a provision halting the Trump administration&aposs ""ill-conceived"" deal to save ZTE, which has close ties to the Chinese government. ""The threat posed by China and its telecommunications as such are so severe and significant that it regrettably brings me to the point where I cannot support a bill I have always supported in my time here,"" said Rubio, who has served in the Senate since 2011. ""We need to wake up to the threat that China poses to this country because we are running out of time to do so,"" Rubio said. The compromise legislation, negotiated by House and Senate lawmakers, removes a provision reinstating penalties against ZTE and restricting the Chinese company&aposs ability to buy U.S. component parts. ZTE was almost forced out of business after being accused of selling sensitive information to nations hostile to the U.S., namely Iran and North Korea, in violation of trade laws. Trump warned in May that the ban was causing heavy job losses in China, and the Commerce Department reached a deal to lift the ban in June, allowing business with U.S. companies to resume. The bill retains language blocking U.S. government purchases and contracts with ZTE. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought the military equipment waiver, saying it would help countries such as India that are seeking to ""pull away from the Russian orbit."" The waiver would not benefit Russia, Mattis said, but would benefit the U.S. and countries wishing to pursue a security relationship with the U.S., including Vietnam and Indonesia. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the waiver undermines U.S. efforts to crack down on Russia in the wake of its interference in the 2016 elections. Menendez said he worried that the bill might hamper Congress&apos ability to block arms sale to countries that formerly did business with Russia. The defense bill drops several Republican proposals related to the environment, including one that would have barred the Fish and Wildlife Service from using the Endangered Species Act to protect two chicken-like birds in the Western half of the U.S. The House-approved language would have blocked endangered-species listing for the sage grouse and lesser-prairie chicken for 10 years. The birds have become flashpoints in an ongoing battle over whether they warrant federal protection that hinders mining and other development. The bill also drops an effort to loosen Cabinet control over the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for securing the nation&aposs nuclear weapons stockpile. The bill is named after Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who is away from Congress battling brain cancer. McCain issued a statement after the vote saying he was proud of the bill and humbled that his colleagues named it after him. ""Serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee has been an incredibly meaningful experience since my first days on Capitol Hill,"" McCain said, calling his tenure as chairman ""one of the greatest honors"" in a 32-year Senate career. The bill that bears his name ""represents an important opportunity to implement an effective approach to confront a growing array of threats around the world"" and ""provide America&aposs service members the resources and tools they need to succeed,"" McCain said. The annual measure sets policies and a budget outline for the Pentagon, to be funded by a later appropriations bill that typically follows the policy measure fairly closely. The provision on the military parade Trump is planning in November would block spending on certain vehicles, equipment and operational units if Mattis determines it would impede military readiness.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-sends-defense-bill-with-military-pay-raise-to-trump,DEFENSE,Fox News,

01/08/2018,2018,8,1,John Yoo,"John Yoo: Yes, Trump could end the Mueller probe right now (but he may not want to)","close Video Trump calls on Sessions to stop 'rigged' Mueller probe President Trump calls on his attorney general to end the Mueller investigation. John Roberts reports from the White House. Democrats went ballistic Wednesday with a torrent of attacks on President Trump, saying he may be guilty of obstruction of justice for tweeting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should end Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The  presidential tweet  that sparked the furor stated: â€œ..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!â€ But despite what President Trumpâ€™s opponents say, the Constitution makes clear that the president has the power to order the Justice Department to end any and all investigations he wishes â€“ and the Mueller investigation is no exception. Article II of the Constitution places the duty to â€œtake care that the laws are faithfully executedâ€ on the president â€“ and the president alone. It was well understood at the time of the Constitutionâ€™s ratification that the president has control over all federal law enforcement. Even creating the post of special counsel â€“ now occupied by Mueller â€“ cannot transfer the presidentâ€™s power over law enforcement to an entity that lacks accountability to the American people. To allow anyone else to exercise any aspect of the presidentâ€™s authority would sap him of â€œenergy in the executive,â€ as Alexander Hamilton called it.Â As Hamilton observed in the Federalist Papers â€“ a collection of essays to support ratification of the Constitution â€“ â€œgood governmentâ€ requires â€œenergy in the executive.â€ Hamilton wrote that a vigorous president is â€œessential to the protection of the community from foreign attacksâ€ and â€œthe steady administration of the laws.â€ From a constitutional perspective, all other federal law enforcement officers â€“ from the attorney general on down â€“  assist  the president in carrying out his constitutional duty. All federal prosecutors are the presidentâ€™s subordinates. As James Madison, who drafted the Constitution and led the fight for its ratification, observed: the president enjoys â€œthe power of appointing, overseeing and controlling those who execute the laws.â€ Presidents have long directed investigations and prosecutions. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson routinely commanded prosecutors, and John Adams ordered the filing of Sedition Act cases. As a result, President Trump controls the Department of Justice, including  all  of its prosecutors, â€œspecialâ€ or not. But in this case, President Trumpâ€™s tweet is just blowing in the wind. As a matter of presidential statesmanship and political prudence, he would be wise to allow the Mueller probe to reach its conclusion. Because the Constitution makes him the nationâ€™s chief law enforcement officer, the president has an interest in allowing the machinery of justice to proceed to its natural end. As far as we know, Mueller does not appear to have uncovered evidence that President Trump conspired with Russian officials to violate any federal laws â€“ conspiracy is a federal crime; collusion is not. And it appears that Mueller accepts the Justice Departmentâ€™s view that the department cannot make the president a target of a prosecution. If Mueller clears President Trump, the special counselâ€™s finding will carry the greatest national credibility and will allow our nation to move forward to far more important issues of domestic and foreign policy. Even if President Trump wanted to follow through on his tweet, he addressed it to the wrong person. He cannot order Sessions to end the Mueller investigation, because the attorney general has recused himself from any involvement in that investigation. Rather than a tweet about ending the Mueller probe, President Trump could try calling Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is serving as acting attorney general and supervising Mueller following Sessionsâ€™ recusal. If the president ordered Rosenstein to fire Mueller, Rosenstein would probably resign, since he was the one who first appointed Mueller. But if Rosenstein didnâ€™t resign the president could fire him for refusing to carry out an order to dismiss the special counsel and end his investigation. President Trumpâ€™s order to fire Mueller would then fall to the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, a Trump appointee whose primary job is managing the governmentâ€™s cases before the Supreme Court. Francisco would have to decide whether to resign or to order the end of the Mueller investigation. While Francisco would have no constitutional grounds on which to refuse, he would no doubt remember Solicitor General Robert Bork. Bork fired the Watergate special prosecutor in October 1973 after the attorney general and deputy attorney general at the time resigned rather than carry out President Nixonâ€™s orders to fire the prosecutor. Democrats happily used the incident as ammunition to torpedo Borkâ€™s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. Ordering the end of an investigation would not constitute obstruction of justice under federal criminal law. Importantly, the laws on obstruction do not specifically mention the president â€“ and courts have usually concluded that such laws do not apply to a presidentâ€™s constitutional acts. Further, President Trumpâ€™s debatable actions are not corrupt beyond a reasonable doubt, as obstruction requires. These include the presidentâ€™s alleged request to FBI Director James Comey to give lenient treatment to then-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, his later firing of Comey, and now his tweet calling for an end to the Mueller investigation. The president may believe in good faith that the prosecutions in the Russia probe are wasting limited federal time and resources and that he had multiple grounds for firing Comey â€“ including Comeyâ€™s mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email probe and politicization of FBI investigations. But if the presidentâ€™s critics truly believe he has committed obstruction of justice, their remedy will not come from the criminal law, but from the Constitution â€“ which gives Congress the power to remove the president from office through impeachment. The framers of the Constitution didnâ€™t want the United States to be ruled by a king unaccountable to anyone. They wanted a president to be held accountable for misdeeds, and gave Congress the power to remove the president from office if he has committed â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanors.â€ Right now, both the Senate and House are probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. These probes have the power to subpoena witnesses and hold public hearings to lay out the facts. Such hearings are exactly what happened when President Nixon faced impeachment after being accused of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress in the Watergate scandal. Hearings were also held during impeachment proceedings against President Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. President Nixon resigned before the House could vote on impeachment charges. The House voted to bring impeachment charges against President Clinton, but he was acquitted after a trial in the Senate. If Congress believes that President Trump has obstructed justice, it can begin impeachment proceedings for â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanors.â€ And despite that phrase, impeachment does not require the president to have committed a crime. Instead, as Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers, â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanorsâ€ include political offenses that proceed from â€œthe misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.â€ The House and Senate will have to make their own judgments about whether President Trumpâ€™s tweet calling for an end to the Mueller investigation â€“ or further action he might take resulting in Muellerâ€™s firing â€“ amount to an offense for which the penalty is removal from the presidency.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/john-yoo-yes-trump-could-end-the-mueller-probe-right-now-but-he-may-not-want-to,OPINION,Fox News,

The Trump administration on Wednesday sanctioned top Turkish officials over the countryâ€™s detention of American pastor Andrew Craig Brunson. The Treasury Department sanctions, first announced by the White House, target Turkey&aposs minister of justice and minister of interior over the holding of the 50-year-old pastor. â€œPastor Brunsonâ€™s unjust detention and continued prosecution by Turkish officials is simply unacceptable,â€ Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. â€œPresident Trump has made it abundantly clear that the United States expects Turkey to release him immediately.â€ The administration said the two sanctioned officials -- Turkey&aposs Minister of Justice Abdulhamit Gul and Minister of Interior Suleyman Soylu -- both played leading roles in the organizations responsible for Brunson&aposs arrest and detention. The sanctions effectively block any property or interest in property controlled by them in the U.S., and bar Americans from engaging in transactions with them. Brunson, an evangelical pastor, was arrested in December 2016 and jailed. He was recently released to home detention. In Ankara, Turkey called on the U.S. to reverse its decision and promised to ""respond in kind without delay"" against what it described as an aggressive stance by the Trump administration. It did not elaborate on possible measures. Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier warned the U.S. not to impose sanctions against his government. Late Saturday, Turkish media quoted Erdogan as saying that Washington ""cannot make Turkey back down with sanctions."" The pastor, who is originally from Black Mountain, N.C., has lived in Turkey for 23 years and led Izmir Resurrection Church. Brunson was detained in the aftermath of a failed 2016 coup on charges of ""committing crimes on behalf of terror groups without being a member"" and espionage. He faces a prison sentence of up to 35 years if he is convicted on both counts at the end of his ongoing trial. Vice President Mike Pence told Fox Newsâ€™ ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Brunson&aposs release to house arrest ""is just not good enough."" ""Pastor Andrew Brunson is an innocent man.

          In this Nov. 23 photo, gas prices are displayed at a Chevron gas station in San Francisco.
           (AP) WASHINGTON â€“  The Trump administration says people would drive more and be exposed to increased risk if their cars get better gas mileage, an argument intended to justify freezing Obama-era toughening of fuel standards. Transportation experts dispute the arguments, contained in a draft of the administration&aposs proposals prepared this summer, excerpts of which were obtained by The Associated Press. The excerpts also show the administration plans to challenge California&aposs long-standing authority to enact its own, tougher pollution and fuel standards. Revisions to the mileage requirements for 2021 through 2026 are still being worked on, the administration says, and changes could be made before the proposal is released as soon as this week. The Trump administration gave notice earlier this year that it would roll back tough new fuel standards put into place in the waning days of the Obama administration. Anticipating the new regulation, California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration in May. Overall, ""improvements over time have better longer-term effects simply by not alienating consumers, as compared to great leaps forward"" in fuel efficiency and other technology, the administration argues. It contends that freezing the mileage requirements at 2020 levels would save up to 1,000 lives per year. New vehicles would be cheaper â€” and heavier â€” if they don&apost have to meet more stringent fuel requirements and more people would buy them, the draft says, and that would put more drivers in safer, newer vehicles that pollute less. At the same time, the draft says that people will drive less if their vehicles get fewer miles per gallon, lowering the risk of crashes. David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said he&aposs doubtful about the administration&aposs estimate of lives saved because other factors could affect traffic deaths, such as automakers agreeing to make automatic emergency braking standard on all models before 2022. ""They&aposre making assumptions about stuff that may or may not be the same,"" he said. Experts say the logic that heavier vehicles are safer doesn&apost hold up because lighter, newer vehicles perform as well or better than older, heavier versions in crash tests, and because the weight difference between the Obama and Trump requirements would be minimal. ""Allow me to be skeptical,"" said Giorgio Rizzoni, an engineering professor and director of the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University. ""To say that safety is a direct result of somehow freezing the fuel economy mandate for a few years, I think that&aposs a stretch."" Experts say that a heavier, bigger vehicle would incur less damage in a crash with a smaller, lighter one and that fatality rates also are higher for smaller vehicles. But they also say that lighter vehicles with metals such as aluminum, magnesium, titanium and lighter, high-strength steel alloys perform as well or better than their predecessors in crash tests. Alan Taub, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan, said he would choose a 2017 Malibu over a heavier one from 20 years earlier. It&aposs engineered better, has more features to avoid crashes and additional air bags, among other things. ""You want to be in the newer vehicle,"" he said. An April draft from the Trump administration said freezing the requirements at 2020 levels would save people $1,900 per new vehicle. But the later draft raises that to $2,100 and even as high as $2,700 by 2025. Environmental groups questioned the justification for freezing the standards. Luke Tonachel, director of the clean-vehicle program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the risk from people driving more due to higher mileage is ""tiny and maybe even negligible."" Under the Trump administration proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 mpg in real-world driving, and that wouldn&apost change through 2026. California has had the authority under the half-century-old Clean Air Act to set its own mileage under a special rule allowing the state to curb its chronic smog problem. More than a dozen states follow California&aposs standards, amounting to about 40 percent of the country&aposs new-vehicle market. Asked if he thinks a freeze in U.S. mileage standards is warranted, EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler told a small group of reporters at EPA headquarters last week, ""I think we need to go where the technology takes us"" on fuel standards. Wheeler did not elaborate. Agency spokespeople did not respond when asked specifically if the EPA acting chief was making the case that modern cars could be both fuel efficient and safe. Wheeler also spoke out for what he called ""a 50-state solution"" that would keep the U.S car and truck market from splitting between two different mileage standards. The Department of Transportation said in a statement that the final fuel economy standards would be based on sound science. The department cautioned that a draft doesn&apost capture the whole picture of the proposed regulation. The draft said a 2012 analysis of fuel economy standards under the Obama administration deliberately limited the amount of mass reduction necessary under the standards. This was done ""in order to avoid the appearance of adverse safety effects,"" the draft stated.",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/lower-fuel-economy-standards-will-save-lives-trump-administration-says,Safety,Fox News,

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday brushed back criticism of President Trump&aposs controversial tweet urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia probe, telling reporters he was merely voicing his ""opinion."" After Democrats claimed the tweet amounted to obstruction of justice, Sanders said the president was not actually giving an order to end the probe. â€œItâ€™s not an order, itâ€™s the presidentâ€™s opinion,â€ Sanders said. â€œIt is ridiculous all the dishonesty thatâ€™s gone on, and the president has watched this process play out, but also wants to see this come to an end.â€ Sanders maintained, though, that the White House wants the investigation to â€œbe completed,â€ and said this should happen â€œsooner rather than later.â€ Also on Wednesday, counsel to the president, Jay Sekulow, told Fox News that the presidentâ€™s tweet was not an order. â€œThe President did not issue an order or directive to the Department of Justice,â€ Sekulow said in a statement to Fox News. The defense of the presidentâ€™s comments come after he posted a series of tweets blasting the Russia investigation. â€œThis is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œBob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to the USA!â€ The tweet renewed Democratic complaints that Trump is wrongly challenging the independence of the special counsel. Trump has repeatedly blasted the probe as a â€œwitch hunt,â€ but the call for Sessions to intervene represents another escalation. Sessions, however, already recused himself last year â€“ handing off oversight to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. So he is unlikely to act. A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the tweet when reached by Fox News. But Democrats on Wednesday blasted the presidentâ€™s statement as an example of obstruction of justice. Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted: â€œThe President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated. This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it.â€ But Sanders maintained that the presidentâ€™s tweets were not obstruction. â€œHe is fighting back,â€ Sanders said. â€œHe is stating his opinion and stating it clearly and certainly, expressing the frustration weâ€™ve seen with the level of corruption from people like James Comey, Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe. There is no reason he shouldnâ€™t be able to voice that opinion.â€ The presidentâ€™s tweets also came on the second day of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafortâ€™s trialâ€”the first out of Muellerâ€™s probe. â€œPaul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didnâ€™t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!â€ he tweeted.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer released a statement On Wednesday announcing that Trump had asked him to consider increasing tariffs from the initial 10 percent proposal to 25 percent on about $200 billion in imports as â€œChina continues to double down on unfair practices.â€ â€œOn June 18, the president directed me to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent, in response to Chinaâ€™s decision to cause further harm to U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses by imposing retaliatory duties on U.S. goods,â€ Lighthizer said. â€œThis week, the president has directed that I consider increasing the proposed level of the additional duty from 10 percent to 25 percent.â€ While the tariffs would not be imposed until after a period of public comment ends on Sept. 5, a senior administration official said that Trump â€œremains open to conversations,â€ and that the administration is â€œin contact with our Chinese counterparts.â€  China has been accused of continuing to engage in unfair trading practices, particularly in tech, and, according to one official, its government has missed â€œmany opportunitiesâ€ to address specific concerns presented by the U.S. â€œThe Trump administration continues to urge China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,â€ Lightizerâ€™s statement read. â€œWe have been very clear about the specific changes China should undertake. Regrettably, instead of changing its harmful behavior, China has illegally retaliated against U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.â€ The administration had previously imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6 over similar concerns that Beijing was stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Â China responded by implementing its own penalties on U.S. goods.  Chinese officials responded early Wednesday to threats of higher tariffs by saying they would retaliate again. ""If the United States takes further measures that escalate the situation, China will definitely fight back,"" said Geng Shuang a foreign ministry spokesman. â€œWe are determined to safeguard our legitimate and lawful rights and interests.â€ One senior administration officialÂ  said that Washington is ready to engage in talks with Beijing, but that â€œTrump is willing to take tough action in a way previous administrations have not in order to further discussions.â€ The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-asks-trade-rep-to-consider-boosting-tariffs-on-chinese-imports-from-10-percent-to-25,Economic Policy,Fox News,

Analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel. This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" August 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It&aposs not an order. It&aposs the president&aposs opinion, and it&aposs ridiculous that all of the corruption and dishonesty that has gone on with the launching of the witch hunt, it&aposs not weak for the president of the United States to state his opinion.  SEN. CHRISTOPHER COONS, Dâ€”DEL.: It&aposs ridiculous. If the president is innocent he should act like it, and he should cooperate with the Mueller investigation, have it go through to it&aposs logical conclusion, and then have his name cleared.  SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, Râ€”MAINE: What the president tweeted is unfortunate. I think it&aposs inappropriate for him to be commenting on an ongoing investigation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, as most days, some tweet gets a lot of attention and raises some eyebrows. Today this was the one, ""This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA.""  Adam Schiff on the House Intelligence Committee tweeting ""The president of the United States just called on his attorney general to put an end to an investigation in which the president, his family, and campaign may be implicated. This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it."" Rudy Giuliani, the president&aposs attorney, weighed in after that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP&aposS ATTORNEY: We said this, Jay Sekulow and I when we heard the statement today, he&aposs saying the same thing we said. I said it about two weeks ago, Jay said it actually just yesterday on Fox that we believe that the investigation should be brought to a close. We think they are the end of it. They should render a report. I guess, put up or shut up, what do you got?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Let&aposs bring in our panel from Washington, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for ""The Washington Times,"" Amy Walter, national editor for the ""Cook Political Report,"" and Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for ""Axios.""  Jonathan, let me start with you at the White House. We&aposve seen a ton of tweets from the president where he expresses his opinion. This one got a lot of attention because it sounded like he was giving an order.  JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, ""AXIOS"": Yes. Honestly it shouldn&apost have got -- I know we have to cover presidential tweets and statements and whatever. But I knew -- I spoke to Rudy Giuliani a couple nights ago. They have been saying this stuff for months. The president has it within his power to fire Mueller, he could do it. There&aposs nothing stopping him from doing it except the fact that he knows full well that it&aposs a red line for Congress and it really would trigger a lot of these members to do, frankly, things that are probably beyond his control.  So he continues to vent, he continues to attack Mueller. This is part of that. This is not of a different category even though to a lay reader who hasn&apost been covering Trump for three years, yes, it might look like this is a new dimension. But actually it&aposs just the same thing that we&aposve seen every single day, which is attacking the probe, attacking the investigation, and attacking Mueller.  BAIER: Amy?  AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": It seems the one new thing that he did, though, was to bring in Jeff Sessions into the discussion rather than it just being about how terrible Bob Mueller is and the rigged witch hunt and all of this. Now it&aposs saying Jeff Sessions should end this.  Now, is that a directive for him to end it? No. He&aposs not saying you need to do this or I demand that you do this. But I think we have to get to the bottom line here, which is his tweets either mean something or they don&apost mean something. So some days they are important, some days they don&apost mean anything. Some days they&aposre the word of the president, some days he&aposs just venting. He is the president of the United States. He can&apost vent off in the way a regular person can through whatever social media account they have. It carries a great deal of weight.  The other thing I would say is, if you lawyer tells you, Bret, this is absolutely legal, you can do it, I would just say it&aposs probably not a good idea for you to do this. It&aposs putting you in a difficult position, and then you kept doing it, then somebody is going to come back to you and say we told you, you shouldn&apost have done that, it wasn&apost a good idea. It&aposs putting you in a bad situation and let&aposs not make it worse. But that&aposs not what&aposs happening.  BAIER: Charlie, we often on the panel turn to this and say why does this always go to 11, our reaction to it? But it does.  CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": Yes, and when everything is 11, nothing is 11, or 10 for that matter, eventually. We have two situations going on here. You do have a legal situation, but in that legal situation there has been no credible proof thus far that Donald Trump has done anything wrong.  You also have a political situation, and Donald Trump as president, as an American, has every right to weigh in on the political matter, on the political side of things. And the way I read that tweet and all of these tweets is that he is weighing in on the political situation, he is issuing a political message, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that and there&aposs nothing inappropriate. I do get that it&aposs sort of a shock to the system around here. It&aposs not the way Washington normally operates. But this is a guy who doesn&apost care about any of that, and he has every right to defend himself. And as obnoxious as a lot of people around here find it, he does a very good job of defending himself.  BAIER: OK, let&aposs turn to tariffs. This is substantive, it&aposs happening, it&aposs affecting a lot of people. The proposal now is to float the idea of increasing the proposed tariffs on the next $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Sources telling us there is a realization even by all of those at the table that China is a bad actor and the scope of China taking advantage of America on trade makes it difficult to come to any compromise. Here is the president calling into Rush Limbaugh. I referenced earlier with Williams. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our farmers, we&aposre going to open up markets for them. But they are great patriots. I watch them --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Well, he continued that thought to say that farmers are going to possibly take it on the chin in the short term. Jonathan, this is real. It&aposs really stepping up, and they believe that they can hold the line, right.  SWAN: It might be real. It&aposs still a threat. He still has only put a fairly small dollar value of tariffs on China. There&aposs a couple things here. One is the 10 percent of the $200 billion which was the original threat was kind of a joke because the currency movement, when this trade war started the Chinese currency went down, so that advantaged their exporters. So actually even trade experts who oppose all of this were kind of laughing and saying this was a bit of a joke. So 25 percent, OK, that&aposs a real threat.  He&aposs making a big gamble. His gamble is that he can break President Xi. And you have a president of the United States, yes, who has a very powerful economy, but he also has to deal with domestic politics. He has to worry about the farmers. He has to worry about members of Congress, he has to worry about the midterm elections. Then on the other side you have president for life Xi who doesn&apost have to worry about this. He&aposs an authoritarian leader who can use all sorts of tools for his economy. So yes, it&aposs true, the two economies are very interwoven, China is very dependent on the U.S. to sell their products. So yes, Trump has some leverage, but it&aposs a big gamble if he really pushes it to the next level.  BAIER: Amy, just how it plays.  WALTER: I think Jonathan set it up really well as a gamble, especially if you&aposre thinking politically. And it is true, even when I looked through the polling that was taken in last couple of weeks, those who support the president most strongly are in rural areas. Those who dislike the tariffs most strongly are in urban areas, i.e. not people who are feeling the pinch from the commodity price drop. So I think the president has something when he says that farmers are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. The question is for how long. And is it going to be until post midterm elections? And even if they give him the benefit of the doubt, what are they expecting from their members of Congress who right now are saying, at least publicly, we don&apost like this, we are trying to tell the president to kind of hold back.  BAIER: Right. And so it&aposs a game of chicken as described earlier. Panel, stand by. Next up, how a new alternative to ObamaCare will play in the midterms.

          Madonna told Vogue Italia that Donald Trump was part of the reason why she moved her family to Portugal.
           (AP) Madonna suggested in a new interview that she relocated her family from their Manhattan base across the Atlantic Ocean to Portugal to escape Donald Trump. The singer spoke to Vogue Italia about the motivation behind her big move saying ""this is not America&aposs finest hour."" ""I felt like we needed a change, and I wanted to get out of America for a minute,"" the singer told the magazine, according to  News.com.au. Another reason why Madonna moved to the European country was to help further her son David&aposs budding soccer career. ""I&aposve been desperate to get him into the best academies with the best coaches, but the level of football in America is much lower than the rest of the world,"" Madonna explained. ""I saw his frustration, and I also felt it was a good time."" The singer, who turns 60 on August 16, said as a ""soccer mom"" she has ""no life in a way."" ""Any woman who is a soccer mom could say it kind of requires you to have no life in a way, because things change from week to week and games change from weekend to weekend â€” sometimes theyâ€™re in the city, sometimes theyâ€™re not, and we would never know until Thursday night whether theyâ€™re on Saturday or Sunday, if at twelve oâ€™clock or later,"" she shared. The ""Material Girl"" singer said that even if David doesn&apost become the next Cristiano Ronaldo, she just wants all of her kids to be ""good human beings."" ""A lot of people say to me, â€˜You must really want your son to be a successful soccer player, your oldest daughter (Lourdes) to be a dancer, Rocco to be a painter&apos...And I always say, &aposNo, what I want my children to be is loving, compassionate, responsible human beings.&apos Thatâ€™s all I want.""",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/madonna-suggests-donald-trump-motivated-her-move-to-portugal,Political,Fox News,

President Trump on Tuesday called the sanctions against Iran that went into effect at midnight ""the most biting sanctions ever imposed,â€ and warned that countries that do business with Tehran will not do business with the U.S. Trump signed an executive order on Monday to restore some of the sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal during the Obama administration, targeting transactions that involve U.S. dollars, as well as the countryâ€™s automotive sector, the purchase of commercial planes and metals including gold. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani responded Monday, ""If someone has knife in the hand and seeks talks, he should first put the knife in his pocket."" Rouhani said he has no pre-conditions for opening talks with the U.S. as long as the Islamic Republic gets paid back for decades of American â€œintervention in Iran.â€ ""If the U.S. government is ready to negotiate about paying compensation to the Iranian nation from 1953 until now,"" Rouhani said. ""The U.S owes the Iranian nation for its intervention in Iran."" Rouhani appears to be referencing the CIA-backed mission to overthrow Iranâ€™s elected prime minister to secure the shahâ€™s rule in 1953, a similar sentiment touted by many of his predecessors.  A senior administration official told Fox News  these restored sanctions are designed to constrict the revenue Iran uses to fund â€œterrorists, dictators, proxy militias, and the regimeâ€™s own cronies.â€ Additional sanctions will resume on Nov. 4, targeting Iran&aposs oil industry and banking sector. Rouhani also said the country can rely on China and Russia to supplement its oil and banking sectors amid the U.S. imposed sanctions. Trump, who has repeatedly vowed to withdraw the U.S. from a nuclear deal that he called  â€œa horrible, one-sided deal that should have never ever been made,â€  has said he is open to negotiating with Iran.

07/08/2018,2018,8,7,Lee Ross,Trump's proposed border wall sees new courtroom scrutiny,"close Video President Trump plays hardball with the border wall National Border Patrol Council president says the border wall is the only humane and permanent solution to the crisis at the border. PASADENA, Calif. â€“  The fate of President Trumpâ€™s proposed border wall returned on Tuesday morning to a California courtroom, where it appears likely to survive another round of judicial scrutiny. In a 40-minute hearing that went deep into the legal morass of which courts could properly hear challenges to the controversial plan, there seemed to be little appetite by the three appellate judges to rule that the administrationâ€™s Department of Homeland Security (DHS)Â  has overstepped its authority. Earlier this year a federal judge in San Diego said the president and the DHS were within their powers to erect new border wall prototypes and replace several sections of existing wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That ruling also cleared the way for the government to waive any environmental laws that could impede construction of the wall, which Trump wants built to further secure the nation&aposs southern border from illegal immigratants hailing from Mexico and Latin America. (The wall was a cornerstone of Trump&aposs 2016 presidential campaign.) The state of California and several environmental groups joined together to challenge that decision, asking the court to reverse course.Â Â They claim the current use of border fence laws passed during the George W. Bush administration as authority for the new construction is improper.Â   They specifically point to provisions that expired in 2008.Â Â â€œIt was never designed for that purpose,â€ California Deputy Attorney General Noah Golden-Krasner told the court. The four environmental groups joining California are the Center for Biological Diversity, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife.Â Â Collectively they expressed concern that the wall is â€œbeing constructed in aÂ Â â€œglobal biodiversity hotspot that includes multiple fragile and sensitive habitats,"" imperiling rare plant species and water quality. 
      Center for Biological Diversity lawyer J.P. Rose told reporters he was hopeful the judges would rule on behalf of the environmental interests where the Trump administration's plan for a southern border wall is concerned.
       (Fox News) But those concerns werenâ€™t addressed in court Tuesday as the judges focused on the scope of executive authority and other more technical issues.Â Â Judge M. Margaret McKeown said she looked at the language of theÂ  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (1996), and found that it provides the administration with the broad authority to erect border barriers. â€œIt doesnâ€™t say anywhere you should only do whatâ€™s listed,â€ the appointee of President Bill Clinton said. Justice Department lawyer H. Thomas Byron III twice said the governmentâ€™s actions fell squarely â€œin the heartlandâ€ of what Congress intended by giving the executive branch wide latitude for border security. Following the hearing, Center for Biological Diversity lawyer J.P. Rose told reporters he was hopeful the judges would rule on behalf of the environmental groups.Â Â There is no timetable for a decision. Also hearing the case were Judges Consuelo Callahan and Jacqueline Nguyen who were appointed to the court by Presidents George W. Bush and Obama respectively.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-proposed-border-wall-sees-new-courtroom-scrutiny,Enforcement,Fox News,

07/08/2018,2018,8,7,Dan Springer,Trump's Kris Kobach endorsement rocks Kansas governor's race,"close Video Republicans Kobach and Colyer go head-to-head in Kansas President Trump bucks GOP advice, endorses Kobach's challenge to incumbent Gov. Colyer; Dan Springer reports from Topeka. Primary day in Kansas comes with a little extra drama. Will a sitting governor be defeated by a controversial conservative who just the day before the polls opened received a big endorsement from President Trump? Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer and Secretary of State Kris Kobach are the leading contenders in a crowded, seven-candidate GOP field. Polls show Colyer and Kobach in a neck-and-neck battle, making Mondayâ€™s Trump tweet endorsement significant.  In it, Trump tweeted, â€œKris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mineâ€¦he is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country-he will be a Great Governor and he has my full and total Endorsement.â€ That endorsement came against the advice of some top Republicans, including reportedly from leaders of the Republican Governorâ€™s Association, who believe Kobach is too polarizing to win in November. Kobach gained national notoriety when he successfully pushed for a law requiring Kansans to prove they are U.S. citizens before registering to vote. The law also requires voters to bring proof of ID to the polls. The law easily passed the Kansas State Legislature, but was later struck down by a U.S. District Court judge. Kobach is appealing the court ruling and makes no apologies for his tough immigration and voter fraud stances. He says this election is about the future direction of the Republican Party. â€œIn 2016, President Trump set a new course for the Republican Party,â€ Kobach said. â€œIn 2018, now the Republican Party is deciding in state after state, â€˜do we want to stay on the course that President Trump charted for us?â€™â€ Colyer supported the voter fraud law and said he agrees with President Trump on everything from his tough immigration positions to his handling of trade with China. But Colyer said Kobachâ€™s aggressive style has turned off the same voters needed to keep the governorâ€™s office in Republican control. â€œRight now his negatives are 55 percent among the general electorate, but for me what this is about is a conservative message that gets things done,â€ Colyer said. â€œKansans and Bob Dole himself says, Jeff Colyerâ€™s the one person who can win the general election.â€ Polls have also shown Colyer with a name recognition problem. One survey showed 39 percent of respondents had no opinion of him. So heâ€™s been barnstorming the state trying to raise his profile. Colyer shook off the Trump endorsement of Kobach, saying the president has a personal relationship with Kobach, who led the presidentâ€™s short-lived commission on voter fraud. Donald Trump Jr. has also hunted with Kobach and has campaigned for him. On the Democratic side, there are five candidates vying for the party nomination. The leader is State Sen. Laura Kelly.  Independent Greg Orman turned in more than enough valid signatures to qualify for the November ballot. He could play spoiler. Orman, a businessman, has some name recognition after running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Political observers say Trumpâ€™s endorsement of Kobach is being cheered by opponents. â€œBoth the Democratic candidate and the independent candidate want Kris Kobach to win the nomination,â€ said Washburn University Political Science professor Bob Beatty. â€œThey believe they can defeat Kris Kobach in a general election because he is so divisive, and heâ€™s relatively unpopular among a number of Kansans.â€ Polls close at 7 p.m. Central Standard Time.

""Frankly it is the position of the legal team, and it&aposs been pretty clear on this, is that there&aposs not a constitutional basis to move an interview forward,"" he said. Sekulow cited several concerns with Mueller&aposs probe, saying it was initiated in part because of the unverified DNC-funded Steele Dossier and what he described as politically motivated leaks by fired FBI Director James Comey. ""The depth of corruption that led to this investigation, and that frankly continues to permeate this investigation, is unprecedented,"" Sekulow told Sean Hannity. Sekulow also raised constitutional concerns with any federal investigation into alleged obstruction of justice by Trump, saying it was ""inappropriate"" to pursue criminal charges against a president for exercising his inherent constitutional powers, such as firing an FBI director. Video ""If you look at the constitutional issues that are implicated by an interview, it&aposs very serious,"" Sekulow said. ""It raises very serious constitutional issues that go to the heart of the separation of powers, and [the president&aposs] Article II authority."" SEKULOW BLAMES &aposBAD INFORMATION&apos FOR MIXUP ON TRUMP TOWER MEETING Sekulow&aposs comments echoed those by fellow Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani,Â  who last month said Mueller could not compel Trump&aposs cooperation through a subpoena Â because federal investigators could not show the requisite need for his testimony. On Sunday,Â  Sekulow blamed ""bad information"" Â for erroneously denying the president had a role in drafting his campaign&aposs response to a key June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. An initial July 2017 statement, dictated by President Trump and issued by Trump Jr. immediately after the meeting came to light, read in part: ""We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago."" The statement made no mention of Trump officials seeking damaging information on Hillary Clinton, which Trump later suggested was in fact the point of the meeting. Video Mueller&aposs team reportedly is looking into the president&aposs actions concerning the meeting, and his tweets. But Sekulow told Hannity that Mueller&aposs actions could have lasting negative ramifications on presidential authority and democracy itself. ""This is not a trial. This is a political process that is going forward,"" Sekulow said. ""The constitutional issues ... in fact are the major issues that this investigation turns on. There are serious constitutional implications not just for this president, but for the presidency, and that&aposs what history will remember."" Sekulow, however, declined to say whether Trump would declassify and release Justice Department and FBI documents currently sought by House investigators through subpoenas related to possible anti-Trump bias and the Russia probe. ""He&aposs respecting the process that&aposs in place; that&aposs not the decision we make as his private lawyers -- we&aposre not the White House Counsel,"" Sekulow said. ""That decision I&aposm sure is being discussed.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sekulow-slams-unprecedented-russia-probe-corruption-says-trump-to-make-final-call-on-mueller-interview,Russia Investigation,Fox News,"

07/08/2018,2018,8,7,Matthew Soerens,President Trump can solve the immigration crisis with legislation that died in 2013,"close Video Trump stands by gov't shutdown threat over border security National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd supports a government shutdown over border security. Border security and illegal immigration continue to be among the most divisive issues our nation faces â€“ and at times it seems like Democrats and Republicans will never agree on what to do. But in 2013 the U.S. Senate passed a bill that, though it died in the House, could serve as a model for effective immigration legislation that might pass and be signed into law â€“ if all sides are willing to make reasonable compromises. The 2013 bipartisan bill would have provided $46 billion for border security improvements. Thatâ€™s nearly double the $25 billion President Trump is now pressing for to build the wall on our border with Mexico. â€œBuild that wall, build that wall, build that wall,â€ President Trumpâ€™s ardent supporters chanted Saturday night  at a campaign rally  in Lewis Center, Ohio, where the president campaigned for a Republican U.S. House candidate running in a special election Tuesday. The president told the crowd that he will make sure the wall along our border with Mexico is built, to fulfill a promise he made repeatedly during his own campaign in the 2016 presidential race. He is clearly determined to get funding for the wall as one of his top priorities. Immigrants crossing our border with Mexico would have covered much of the expense of building the wall under the 2013 legislation because they would each be charged $2,000 in fines, paid gradually, to earn permanent legal status.  But President Trump upset many of his fellow Republicans in Congress, who are generally supportive of his get-tough crackdown on illegal immigration, when  he tweeted July 29 : â€œI would be willing to â€˜shut downâ€™ government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!â€ The threat of a government shutdown is certainly something many Republican members of Congress would rather avoid, since they would likely be held politically responsible in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. But fortunately, if congressional Republicans and the president are willing to practice â€œthe art of the deal,â€ reviving the 2013 Senate bill would give them a proven way forward â€“ one that would fund border security, end the diversity visa lottery, and shift to a merit-based immigration system with the support of a substantial number of Democratic votes in Congress. Immigrants crossing our border with Mexico â€“ who comprise a  slight majority  of the roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully â€“ would have covered much of the expense of building the wall under the 2013 legislation because they would each be charged $2,000 in fines, paid gradually, to earn permanent legal status. Far from the free grace of amnesty, the 2013 bill required those who had either crossed our border or overstayed a visa illegally to make amends. The legislation also provided protection for immigrants brought to the U.S. in violation of the law as children â€“ the Dreamers, who President Trump has  said  include â€œsome absolutely incredible kidsâ€ who should have a  pathway to citizenship . And, of course, under the legislation any immigrant with serious criminal convictions would be denied any chance to stay here with legal status. The 2013 bill would have ended the diversity visa lottery altogether and terminated certain family reunification visas, including for siblings of U.S. citizens and for their married children older than 31. By eliminating these visas and significantly increasing the number of visas for immigrant workers who could meet key needs in the U.S. labor market, the legislation sought to dramatically shift the availability of visas toward the merit-based process President Trump has praised. Many in President Trumpâ€™s evangelical base would support such a move. Most evangelicals tell pollsters they support a path to citizenship for the undocumented, paired with border security improvements. A mere 16 percent of evangelicals are opposed.  Every Democrat in the Senate voted for this bill five years ago, joined by a significant number of Republicans. Certainly, many Democrats disliked particular elements of the bill, including what they viewed as unnecessary spending on border security and eliminating certain visa categories. But they were willing to accept these provisions in exchange for an earned legalization program. Some wonder if Democrats would take the same deal today, allowing President Trump to simultaneously fulfill several key campaign pledges to his base  and  accomplish something Latino voters have seen as a priority for decades, but which both President George W. Bush and President Obama failed to make happen. Indeed, when President Bush last pushed a similar immigration deal, some Senate Democrats  inserted poison-pill amendments  that helped kill a carefully crafted agreement, denying Bush a key legislative victory. Itâ€™s possible such partisan brinksmanship would re-emerge if President Trump were to propose something along the lines of the Senateâ€™s 2013 bipartisan deal today â€“ but he should at least call the Democratsâ€™ bluff. There is, however, significant evidence that the Democrats would be willing to agree to the compromise legislation they supported five years ago â€“ but the presidentâ€™s best interests are continually sabotaged from within. All but three Senate Democrats  already  voted for $25 billion for a border wall  last February  in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers. But the bill failed when congressional Republicans were scared away by a presidential  veto threat ,  courtesy of  White House Domestic Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. Miller, who  advocates cutting legal immigration in half , urged President Trump to reject the deal because it did not include elimination of family reunification visas and the diversity visa lottery. If President Trump is personally committed to cutting legal immigration and deporting all undocumented immigrants, there is simply no deal to be had, at least with this Congress. But if he truly is opposed to a net reduction in legal immigrant visas â€“ as he  explicitly stated  last year â€“ he needs to take the reins and ignore the staffers who have torpedoed congressional negotiations. Many in President Trumpâ€™s evangelical base would support such a move. Thousands of evangelical pastors have affirmed an  Evangelical Statement of Principles for Immigration Reform  very consistent with the 2013 Senate bill, and most evangelicals tell  pollsters  they support a path to citizenship for the undocumented, paired with border security improvements. A mere 16 percent of evangelicals are opposed. The presidentâ€™s fellow business leaders are on board as well. The  U.S. Chamber of Commerce  strongly supported the 2013 effort, because it would be enormously beneficial to the economy. The  Congressional Budget Office estimated  that, over the course of 20 years, the bill would reduce federal deficits by about $900 billion, raise Americansâ€™ wages by 0.5 percent and increase the nationâ€™s gross domestic product by more than 5 percent. We now have two options in front of us. If the president goes with the status quo, weâ€™ll see yet another federal government shutdown â€“ a move that could cost President Trump the House and Senate majorities in the November elections that he needs to govern effectively. But if President Trump brings his famous deal-making skills into play, he can solve a problem that his predecessors have been unable to solve. That would give him something worth tweeting about.

          â€œThe Viewâ€ has made headlines with constant infighting between Joy Behar and the showâ€™s lone conservative, Meghan McCain.
           ABC Newsâ€™ â€œThe Viewâ€ finished the 2017-18 TV season with an average of 2.9 million viewers, making it the showâ€™s most-watched year since Barbara Walters said goodbye four years ago. The reliably liberal â€œViewâ€ regained its place in the pop culture conversation with a panel including Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain â€“ but many observers feel that one person who&aposs not on the panel, in particular, had much to do with the daytime gabfest success. NewsBusters&apos managing editor, Curtis Houck, told Fox News that â€œwithout a doubtâ€ ratings have shot up as a result of the panelists&apos endless discussions regarding President Trump. McCain, the showâ€™s lone conservative, and the fiery Behar have battled about all things politics on a regular basis, creating must-see TV in the process. Goldberg and Hostin arenâ€™t exactly fans of the president, either, and the political landscape has given the panel a lot to talk about. â€œWhether you tune into hate watch, cheer for whatever blurts out from Joy Behar, or see Meghan McCain battling Behar or Whoopi, 'The View' has become prime viewing just like the White House Press Briefing."" â€” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck â€œWhether you tune into hate watch, cheer for whatever blurts out from Joy Behar, or see Meghan McCain battling Behar or Whoopi, &aposThe View&apos has become prime viewing just like the White House press briefing,â€ Houck said. â€œTrump has made shows like this even crazier than before, and thus something people can&apost help but watch.â€ Season 21 of the kicked off in September 2017 and concluded last week. The most-watched season since 2012-13 featured several news-making moments, including the panel suggesting that women vote for whichever candidates their husbands chose; Behar apologizing for joking about Vice President Penceâ€™s Christian faith; various derogatory remarks toward several Republicans; and guest appearances by such vocally anti-Trump figures as comic Kathy Griffin and ESPN&aposs Jemele Hill. Joe Biden, ElizabethÂ Warren, Stormy Daniels, James Comey, Sarah Sanders and Anthony Scaramucci were among the political guests to join the show this season, along with the parade of actors and musicians. Last month, Goldberg even got into a heated confrontation with Fox News host JudgeÂ Jeanine Pirro.  Season 21 also coincided with the #MeToo movement, which the all-female panel was specifically passionate about. The episode that most resonated with viewers? It might have been a September appearance by Hillary Clinton, who appeared to discuss her election loss to Trump in 2016. Political comedian Tim Young told Fox News that â€œThe Viewâ€ was â€œbasically Clinton&aposs on-screen cheering section to begin with,â€ so her supporters â€œknew where to turn for the echo chamber of &aposWe donâ€™t understand how Trump won.&aposâ€ Young said that many other left-leaning talk shows â€œstill pretend to be balanced,â€ but everyone knows that to expect from â€œThe View,â€ which is typically positioned against Trump. Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn told Fox News that Trump certainly helped the show, but he thinks the addition of McCain shouldnâ€™t go unnoticed. â€œBy far the strongest conservative pundit the show has had in years has brought an honest and often fiery debate to the table,â€ Wulfsohn said. Paula Faris and Sara Haines were also key members of the showâ€™s success during Season 21, but wonâ€™t return after the monthlong hiatus. Faris is pursuing other interests, while Haines will co-host a new ABC program called â€œGMA Day.â€  Replacements have not been announced. â€œThe Viewâ€ will return to ABC for its 22nd season on Sept. 4.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joy-behar-the-view-wraps-season-21-with-its-best-ratings-since-the-barbara-walters-era-is-it-the-trump-factor,Media,Fox News,

Several states are holding primary elections Tuesday, including some contests that could prove pivotal in determining whether Republicans or Democrats will control the Senate next year. A tight special U.S. House election also is being held in Ohio as a young Democrat hopes to upset a Republican who has garnered the support of President Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and other party leaders. Early Tuesday, Trump urged Ohio voters to get out and vote for Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson for Congress, over his opponent, Democrat Danny O&aposConnor. ""Ohio, vote today for Troy Balderson for Congress. His opponent, controlled by Nancy Pelosi, is weak on Crime, the Border, Military, Vets, your 2nd Amendment - and will end your Tax Cuts. Troy will be a great Congressman.  #MAGA ,"" Trump tweeted early Tuesday. The Ohio race and others could put Trumpâ€™s influence to the test. Read on for a preview of some of the major elections on Tuesday. Missouri 
      Air Force veteran Tony Monetti, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and former Libertarian Party presidential contender Austin Petersen are vying for the GOP nomination for Republican governor in Missouri.
       Republicans are set to pick their candidate to take on Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, in the fall. McCaskill has represented Missouri in the Senate since 2007, but Fox News has her bid for re-election ratedÂ  as a toss-up . Out of a crowded field of Republican candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has emerged as a favorite, even securing  Trumpâ€™s endorsement  months before the primary election. A lawyer who helped successfully argue before the Supreme Court a case for Hobby Lobby to be exempted from certain ObamaCare rules, Hawley has investigated alleged misuse of a charity donor list by former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, while he was still in office. Greitens eventually resigned earlier this year after  allegations of an affair  that was at times violent and non-consensual surfaced. Austin Petersen, who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president in 2016, and Tony Monetti, an Air Force veteran and restaurant owner, are also running for the Republican nomination. MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE RAFFLING MACHINE THAT CAN PRINT â€˜UNTRACEABLEâ€™ GUN PARTS Monetti has been endorsed by former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Petersen is supported by the Republican Liberty Caucus.

       (Michael Buck/Wood-TV8 via AP) Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, canâ€™t run for re-election due to term limits, but the race to replace him is anything but simple. For the Democrats, Abdul El-Sayed, Shri Thanedar and Gretchen Whitmer are battling for the nomination. Whitmer, a former county prosecutor and member of the state legislature, has emerged as the establishment favorite. El-Sayed, on the other hand, has campaigned as a more progressive choice with Sen. Bernie Sanders and  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  both  lending their support  to the man hoping to become  Michiganâ€™s first Muslim governor . Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, state Sen. Pat Colbeck and Dr. Jim Hines are vying for the GOP nod. Trump endorsed Schuette nearly a year ago, saying he will be good for job growth in Michigan. As for Senate, two Republicans are hoping to secure the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat. African-American business executive and Iraq War pilot John E. James is taking on Sandy Pensler, a detergent manufacturer, in the August contest. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS Trump has  endorsed James , who he called â€œspectacular.â€ â€œRarely have I seen a candidate with such great potential,â€ Trump said in a July tweet. While  Fox News rates Â the gubernatorial race as a toss-up, the Senate election in November still remains likely safe for Democrats. In 2016, Trump narrowly eked out a victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton  in Michigan . Voters in Michigan are able to cast so-called â€œstraight ticketâ€ ballots, meaning they would fill in one bubble to vote for all of one partyâ€™s candidates for office. Typically, voters were only able to pick Republicans or Democrats, but this year  the Libertarian Party also qualified  to nominate candidates for the ballot. â€œIt certainly is historic, both for Michigan and for Libertarians. Many people see it as a real opportunity to bring new blood and new activists into the party,â€ Michigan Libertarian Party chairman Bill Hall  told MLive.com . According to  the Detroit News , Bill Gelineau and John Tatar are both battling for the Libertarian gubernatorial nomination as well, hoping to secure enough votes to ensure the party appears on the 2020 ballot. Kansas 
      Gov. Jeff Colyer, a Republican, is seeking his first full term as Kansas governor.
       (AP Photo/John Hanna) Gov. Jeff Colyer is seeking his first full term leading the state, but the race is expected to be tough. Colyer was serving as Kansasâ€™ lieutenant governor when Trump  selected Sam Brownback  to be the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom in January 2018Â â€” thus elevating Colyer into the stateâ€™s top position. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is also vying for the Republican nomination. Kobach was the vice chairman of the White Houseâ€™s controversial  voter fraud commission , which was dismantled by Trump earlier this year as it faced multiple legal battles and oppositions from states. His involvement with the group has earned him the scorn of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has sent negative flyers to voters ahead of the primary election. Trump endorsed Kobach the day before the primary, saying he has been ""a strong and early supporter"" of the president. LIFELONG NEW YORKER JOINS STUDENTS IN KANSAS GOVERNOR RUN THAT HAS â€˜NO RULESâ€™ Former state Sen. Jim Barnett, Patrick Kucera, Tyler Ruzich, insurance commissioner Ken Selzer and Joseph Tutera Jr. are also running for the GOP nod. Barnett has been  endorsed by the Kansas City Star  and made headlines earlier this year when he  picked his wife  to be his running mate. Fox News rates Â the gubernatorial race as lean-Republican, but Democrats are hoping to change the governorship back to blue for the first time since 2011Â â€” especially if Kobach wins. State Sen. Laura Kelly, former Wichita Mayor Carl Brewer and former Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Joshua Svaty have emerged as the three front-runners in the Democratic primary. The candidates have fought over ties to the National Rifle Association and plans for womenâ€™s reproductive health care in the state,  according to KMUW  public radio station. Washington

       (Official photo) Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, is running for her fourth term in the U.S. Senate â€” but not without a fight from nearly 30 challengers. That group that includes: 13 Republicans, four Democrats, five independents and one Libertarian, among others. Former Washington GOP chairwoman Susan Hutchison has emerged as the leading Republican contender to take on Cantwell,  according to the Seattle Times . WASHINGTON STATE EMPLOYEES SUE TO â€˜ESCAPEâ€™ UNION AFTER JANUS SUPREME COURT RULING According to  FiveThirtyEight , Cantwell has voted with Trumpâ€™s agenda 25 percent of the time, including with the nomination of some  Cabinet appointees : Robert Wilkie for secretary of veterans affairs, Robert Lighthizer for trade representative, Sonny Perdue for agriculture secretary and Dan Coats for director of national intelligence. Fox News rates Â the Senate race as likely Democrat, but Hutchison told the Seattle Times, â€œWe wouldnâ€™t have this crowded ballot if Maria Cantwell wasnâ€™t vulnerable.â€ Clinton  solidly beat  Trump in Washington in the 2016 presidential election.

      President Trump lent a helping hand to Troy Balderson, the Republican vying for a special Ohio election for Congress.
       (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Itâ€™s not a primary election, but Trumpâ€™s influence will certainly be tested in Tuesdayâ€™s special House election in Ohio. The open seat came with the  resignation of Rep. Pat Tiberi  in the 12th district, which has been represented by Republicans for nearly 40 years. But Democrat Danny Oâ€™Connor is hoping to change that  in his race against  Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson. Polls have shown a tight race between the two, even though Balderson has been endorsed by Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The president made an appearance in Ohio just a few days before the election to lend his support as well. â€œA vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,â€ Trump said of Baldersonâ€™s opponent. â€œAnd to let MS-13 run wild in our communities.

07/08/2018,2018,8,7,Brooke Singman,FBI's handling of alleged Feinstein spy spurs claims of double standard with Trump campaign,"
          President Trump has a new nickname for Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
           Revelations that Sen. Dianne Feinstein&aposs former driver and aide was probed by the FBI for allegedly acting as a Chinese spy have spurred claims of a double standard concerning how the bureau handled suspicions of Russian coordination with the Trump campaign. The California Democrat, in a statement last week, said the FBI informed her of its concerns regarding the staffer in her San Francisco office five years ago. Feinstein said she then ousted the staffer â€œimmediately.â€ But this has renewed questions among President Trump&aposs allies about the bureau&aposs approach in 2016 to suspicions regarding his campaign aides&apos potential Russian ties. In one case, the FBI briefed Feinstein; in the other, the bureau proceeded to use an informant and surveillance warrants to get information on Trump campaign figures. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who has been a staunch Trump defender throughout the federal probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with his campaign, complained that Feinstein and Trump were handled differently. â€œProviding a defensive briefing, like the one given to Senator Feinstein, is a typical response to these kinds of situations,â€ Nunes said in a statement to Fox News. â€œThe refusal to give the Trump campaign a defensive briefing, and instead opening a sprawling counter-intelligence investigation of American citizens, is one of many alarming ways that intelligence leaders drastically diverged from normal procedures in their Trump campaign investigation.â€ The FBI reportedly informed Feinstein, then-chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about the spy allegations. The suspected spy served as Feinsteinâ€™s driver in California, but also took on additional responsibilities in the office, such as working as a liaison to the Asian-American community in California. The staffer reportedly attended Chinese consulate events on behalf of the senator, and reportedly was recruited after being befriended by someone from Chinaâ€™s Ministry of State Security. â€œFive years ago the FBI informed me it had concerns that an administrative member of my California staff was potentially being sought out by the Chinese government to provide information,â€ Feinstein said in a statement. â€œHe was not a mole or a spy, but someone who a foreign intelligence service thought it could recruit.â€ Feinstein said the FBI â€œreviewed the matterâ€ and â€œshared its concernsâ€ with her. The staffer was removed. Video â€œHe never had access to classified or sensitive information or legislative matters,â€ Feinstein said. â€œThe FBI never informed me of any compromise of national security information.â€ The  Wall Street Journal editorial board  wrote this week that the issue is â€œwhat the FBI told Mrs. Feinstein but didnâ€™t tell Mr. Trump.â€ â€œThe question Mr. Trump should ask is why the bureau didnâ€™t treat him as a potential President with the same customary courtesy,â€ the editorial said. â€œThe FBI claims it had concerns beginning in spring 2016 that low-level Trump campaign staffers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were colluding with Russians. Yet rather than give the Trump campaign the usual defensive briefing, the FBI launched an unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into a presidentâ€™s campaign, running informants against it and obtaining surveillance warrants.â€ The FBI declined to comment on why Trump was not given the same kind of briefing as Feinstein when the investigation began and when Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants were obtained against Page. But retired FBI special agent and former national spokesman John Iannarelli, who worked at the FBI at the time of the investigation into the Feinstein staffer but not specifically on the case, explained that the difference in bureau procedure could have been based on the narrow scope of the case. â€œThe Feinstein investigation was very narrow, in terms of who their target was, whereas the Trump investigation appears to be much broader,â€ Ianarelli told Fox News, listing Page, Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former campaign staffer Rick Gates. He also suggested the FBI trusted Feinstein with the information. â€œWhen youâ€™re conducting a public corruption investigation, if youâ€™re looking at someone who&aposs working for the official but have nothing to indicate that the official is involved, you may notify the official to prevent the investigation from being compromised,â€ Iannarelli said. Over the weekend, Trump blasted Feinstein for having a â€œChinese spyâ€ in her office for â€œ20 years.â€ â€œThe leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years,â€ Trump said during a rally in Ohio. â€œAnd sheâ€™s leading the Russian witch hunt. Isnâ€™t that something? And then she says to me, â€˜What did you know about this and that?â€™ Give me a break.â€ It is unclear what Trump meant when referring to Feinstein as â€œthe leaderâ€ of the Russia probe, but the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Feinstein serves as ranking member, is running its own investigation into Russian collusion. The president also blasted Feinstein on Twitter last week, questioning whether the senator would â€œinvestigate herself.â€ Feinstein fired back. â€œThe FBI told me 5 years ago it had concerns that China was seeking to recruit an administrative member of my Calif staff (despite no access to sensitive information),â€ Feinstein tweeted. â€œI took those concerns seriously, learned the facts and made sure the employee left my office immediately.â€ She added: â€œCompare that to your actions: attacking the FBI and refusing the advice of your national security team. SAD! I appreciated then and now the diligent work of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies and acted in the best interests of the country. Give it a try!â€ Fox News&apos Chad Pergram and Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report.Â ",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbis-handling-of-alleged-feinstein-spy-spurs-claims-of-double-standard-with-trump-campaign,Russia Investigation,Fox News,

President Trumpâ€™s legal team said Monday they are preparing to send special counsel Robert Mueller a letter that would largely turn down a meeting that would include any â€œquestions related to obstruction of justice,â€ sources told Fox News. Trump attorneys are expected to send their response to Mueller as early as today. Last week, a source said that Trumpâ€™s legal team would consider allowing questions regarding obstruction if they were in written form. â€œIn a perfect world, weâ€™d have a few written questions about the obstruction issue, and oral questions about Russia/collusion,â€ the source said. Rudy Giuliani, the top lawyer on Trumpâ€™s legal team, however, told Fox News â€œwe have real reluctance about allowing any questions regarding obstruction of justice.â€ The Washington Post  was first to report the letter after an interview with Giuliani on Monday, who said the letter is not intended to decline Muellerâ€™s request, rather he hopes to â€œcontinue the negotiations.â€ Talks between Trumpâ€™s lawyers and the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have restarted in recent days, and it is not clear a deal will be struck, The Associated Press reported. Trump has publicly expressed a desire to be interviewed, but his lawyers have repeatedly objected to the investigatorsâ€™ proposals. Trump attorneys say both sides have exchanged proposals for conditions for such a Trump interview. The negotiations come amid a backdrop of Trumpâ€™s escalating attacks on the probe, including his blunt declaration that his attorney general should terminate â€œright nowâ€ the federal probe into the campaign that took him to the White House, a newly fervent attack on the special counsel investigation that could imperil his presidency.

Republicans and President Trump faced a series of major tests on Tuesday, as voters in five states headed to the polls in races that Democrats hoped would serve as an energizing prelude to a liberal takeover of Congress in November. Kansas, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan and Washington are the battlegrounds, and in the run-up to Tuesday, they have seen no shortage of drama -- ranging from insurgent socialist-backed candidates to last-minute, all-in presidential endorsements and attention-getting ads featuring a Jeep equipped with a replica machine gun. Perhaps the most-watched contest is in Ohio, where a special election is being held to determine who will replace retired Rep. Pat Tiberi. Republicans have controlled the 12th Congressional District for more than 35 years, but  polls have shown  the two candidates in the race, upstart Democrat Danny Oâ€™Connor, 31, and two-term Republican State Senator Troy Balderson, 57, in an effective tie. Regardless of who wins on Tuesday to fill Tiberi&aposs seat, the two candidates will square off again in November&aposs general election.  
      Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, left, is trying to become the first Muslim governor in the state.
       (AP) Still, the race is widely seen as aÂ bellwether for the upcoming midterms; Trump carried the district by double-digits in 2016. In an effort to tap into that enthusiasm, Trump shook up the Ohio contest by staging a freewheeling rally in suburban Columbus on Saturday night. In a sweltering auditorium, Trump said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ""controls Danny Oâ€™Connor, whoever the hell that is."" Trump renewed that line of attack on Twitter as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday, saying O&aposConnor is ""weak on Crime"" and promising that Balderson would be a ""great Congressman."" Trump hoped to have a similar 11th-hour effect in Kansas, where less than 24 hours before polls opened, he stunned the party establishment by endorsing Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who had supported the president and worked with him closely. The endorsement was a major blow to Gov. Jeff Colyer, who had the backing of the National Rifle Association and Kansas political legend Bob Dole. It also alarmed some Republicans, who fear that Kobach&aposs hard-line conservative views will alienate voters in the general election and give Democrats an opening. 
      Trump-endorsed Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach frequently drove this Jeep on the campaign trail.
       (Kobach campaign on Facebook) WATCH: WHY IS KOBACH SO CONTROVERSIAL IN KANSAS? Like Trump, Kobach promises a direct rhetorical style, telling voters repeatedly: ""I don&apost back down. I double down."" His use of a Jeep with a replica gun mounted on top (and an American flag paint scheme) during campaign stops this summer prompted backlash. Kobach called his critics ""snowflakes"" and continued to use the Jeep. Kobach  told Fox News&apos ""America&aposs Newsroom""  on Tuesday that he is an ""insurgent conservative"" primarily concerned with cutting taxes and stopping illegal immigration. He added that Trump&aposs endorsement ""helps a great deal."" Other races on Tuesday will set the stage for potentially key races in November that could determine which party controls Congress. In Washington, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, is running for her fourth term in the U.S. Senate â€” but not without a fight from nearly 30 challengers. That group includes: 13 Republicans, four Democrats, five independents and one Libertarian, among others. Video WILL WASHINGTON CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE PULL OFF AN OCASIO-CORTEZ STYLE UPSET? Former Washington GOP chairwoman Susan Hutchison has emerged as the leading Republican contender to take on Cantwell. AlthoughÂ Fox News ratesÂ the Senate race as likely to break Democratic, Hutchison told The Seattle Times, â€œWe wouldnâ€™t have this crowded ballot if Maria Cantwell wasnâ€™t vulnerable.â€ Also in Washington,Â 30-year-old Sarah Smith â€“ the progressive challenger to Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Tuesday&aposs 9thÂ Congressional District primary --  is hoping to replicate  the unexpected success of 28-year-old socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Smith has frequently compared herself to Cortez on the campaign trail, and her platform shares many similarities to Cortez&aposs.

McCaskill has represented Missouri in the Senate since 2007, but Fox News  has her bid for re-election ratedÂ as a toss-up . Out of a crowded field of Republican candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has emerged as a favorite, even securingÂ Trumpâ€™s endorsementÂ months before the primary election.

          The Trump star on the Walk of Fame. It has been defaced repeatedly.
           (Reuters) The West Hollywood City Council passed a resolution on Monday night asking to have President Trump&aposs star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame,Â saying he should be stripped of the honor after â€œattacksâ€ on minorities and immigrants. â€œEarning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an honor. When one belittles and attacks minorities, immigrants, Muslims, people with disabilities or women, the honor no longer exists,â€ West Hollywood Mayor John Duran said at a meeting. Duran said the resolution has nothing to do with Trump being a Republican or a conservative. He also conceded that he does not have direct authority over the Walk of Fame. â€œItâ€™s up to them,â€ he told Fox News. To add some perspective, Â no stars have ever been removed. Indeed, several people who have been accused of sexual harassment during the #MeToo movement are still enshrined, such as actors Kevin Spacey and Jeffrey Tambor. And while West Hollywood lobbies for Trumpâ€™s star to be removed, Bill Cosby is still honored despite being convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Other controversial figures, past and present, also continue to be represented on the Walk of Fame, despite a litany of scandals. Among them: Roseanne Barr, Charlie Sheen, Michael Jackson, director Brett Ratner and Roscoe â€œFattyâ€ Arbuckle. â€œThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is a registered historic landmark. Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Because of this, we have never removed a star from the Walk,â€ Walk of Fame president Leron Gubler s aid in 2015 when asked about Cosbyâ€™s star . Mayor Duran did not immediately respond when asked about whether any of these other figures should have their stars removed. Actor and outspoken conservative James Woods â€“- he also has a star â€“- said he thinks liberal members of the City Council  will regret their decision  to lobby for the removal of Trumpâ€™s star. â€œThe problem with purges historically is that one political side enjoys them until they canâ€™t stop them. The founders of any revolution usually end up next in line to the guillotine,â€ Woods tweeted. Trump was awarded his star on the prestigious stretch of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles in 2007, at the height of his â€œApprenticeâ€ TV show fame, and it has been defaced and vandalized numerous times since he has been in the White House.

          Mark Hamill poses with his new Hollywood Walk of Fame star.
           (Reuters) Following the news that the West Hollywood City Council has passed a resolution to have President Donald Trumpâ€™s star removed from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, â€œStar Warsâ€ actor Mark Hamill is seizing the opportunity to advocate for the late Carrie Fisher to be honored in his place. Hamill, who has been outspoken about his distaste for the president,Â  took to Twitter  shortly after the news broke about Trumpâ€™s star to call for the City Council to give Fisher his spot. â€œHow about replacing it with someone who really earned it? Like @carriefisher,â€ he wrote. Fisherâ€™s co-stars from the famed science fiction franchise, Hamill and Harrison Ford, already have stars with the former receiving his in 2003 and the latter earlier this year. Sadly, despite the 66-year-old starâ€™s advocacy, fans shouldnâ€™t expect to see a star in Fisherâ€™s name any time soon. 
      Carrie Fisher has not yet received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
       (AP) As  The Los Angeles Daily News  reports, Fisherâ€™s sudden death in 2016 complicates her inclusion on the Walk of Fame. Thanks to a not-so-well-known tradition, there is a mandatory mourning period of five years before a departed famous person can be honored with a star. However, the outlet confirmed that Fisher is definitely in the running once that time period is up in 2021. At the time of her death, fans flocked to a makeshift star on the Walk of Fame where someone wrote Fisherâ€™s name on a blank star along with the words â€œMay the Force be with you always.â€ Donald Trump was awarded his star in 2007 for his work producing the ""Miss Universe"" pageant. However, in the wake of numerous acts of vandalism, presumably from people who disagree with his political actions as president, the city council  voted to remove the star  rather than continue to fix it. â€œWest Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,â€  announced Mayor John Duran on Twitter .

14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Stephen Yates,Trump's 'no more apologizing for America' foreign policy helps Republicans in November,"close Video Is Trump's foreign policy boosting America's standing? President's 'America First' policy doubles down on tariffs and sanctions. One of the all-time best lines in television and politics was delivered by the late Fred Thompson on â€œLaw and Order.â€ To his assistant district attorney he advised, â€œJack, itâ€™s not enough to do good. You have to be seen doing good.â€ So too with presidents and national security. Itâ€™s not enough to keep America secure. Voters must feel more secure. One of the key themes of the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland was, â€œMake America Safe Again.â€ Turns out that a huge number of voters did not feel safe under Obama policies, despite his tenure being widely celebrated around the world. Demand for change was fed by talk of open borders, unenforced red lines, flexibility with Russia, ISIS, Benghazi, plus lost opportunities in manufacturing and energy. Not only has the president and Congress made America safer, most Americans feel safer and better off. Republicans running on this record, together with the strong economic revival at home, stand a very good chance of defying history this election cycle.  Trump famously broke all predictive models in building a new electoral college coalition in 2016. He may be defying history and the â€œbest and brightestâ€ predictive models for the mid-term elections in 2018, with strategic moves on trade and foreign policy playing a major role. Trump is winning on trade and diplomacy and that will help energize his base in midterms. People are proud after a long era of Democrats apologizing for America. ISIS is gone from the headlines. Finally, we have a president who puts muscle behind rebalancing alliance and trade relationships in our favor. Most â€œexpertsâ€ mistake his approach as a revival of nationalism or isolationism, but in reality, Trump represents a new pro-American internationalism, without apology. And mainstream Americans support it. Turns out it also is popular to keep promises made during a campaign. The U.S. embassy is now in Israelâ€™s capital. The U.S. exited bad deals â€“ the Paris Climate Accord and Iran deal. No more disappearing red lines and no more nation-building. And no more multilateral trade deals that weaken American sovereignty or our economy.Â  Unconventional tweets and summits resonate with flyover America. Economic revival at home projects strength and opportunity abroad. Absent a shock between now and election day, most Americans feel safer and more confident in Americaâ€™s role in the world. Trump themes of sovereignty, security, fair trade, and international realism resonate strongly with mainstream America and are hard for Democrats to oppose. Not only has the president and Congress made America safer, most Americans feel safer and better off.

14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Robert Charles,Here's how Trump can end the whole Mueller investigation farce,"close Video Swamp Watch: James Comey and Robert Mueller Mueller and Comey are model public servants, we're told. Special Counsel Robert Mueller seems determined to press forward with some version of the Spanish Inquisition â€“ an increasingly indefensible, apparently groundless, objectively debilitating inquiry into what was initially one question: Did the Trump campaign knowingly coordinate with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election? Barring something that has remained hidden for more than 20 months, Americans know the facts: Muellerâ€™s inquisition was triggered by several Obama-Clinton partisans, including anti-Trump appointees at the FBI and CIA. The names of these partisans now trigger nausea: Fired FBI Director James Comey; former CIA Director John Brennan; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok (whose firing was announced Monday); former FBI lawyer Lisa Page (who was carrying on an extramarital affair with Strzok); and several others. Even the story line is now nauseating. Comey, despite holding clearances as head of the FBI, contradicted himself before Congress, leaked documents through a secret cutout, proudly triggered Muellerâ€™s appointment, and then cashed in with a big-money book. Brennan traded his role as intelligence briefer in President Clintonâ€™s White House for political gain in President Obamaâ€™s. When he ran the CIA he fed partisan anti-Trump information to the FBI, possibly circumventing U.S. laws by procuring foreign involvement. By some reports, he may have even sought to legally block Trumpâ€™s inauguration. This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy â€“ exactly what Russia, China and Iran want â€“ but it does no one any good.  Clapper, already famous for misleading Congress under oath, became another vocal anti-Trump detractor. Then Andrew McCabe, No. 2 at the FBI under Comey, turned out to be a subterranean anti-Trump partisan, who was reproached by the Justice Departmentâ€™s inspector general for breach of integrity. And as for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, despite FBI employment and centrality to an â€œinvestigationâ€ clearing Hillary Clinton, both were prolific anti-Trump texting partners and made it clear that they did not want to see him become president. The saga rivals a Shakespearean tragedy, and has frankly made average Americans disgusted. It now threatens to darken Americaâ€™s midterm elections â€“ exactly what the Russians have wanted, we know now. So I have a recommendation for ending the tragedy before our country is consumed by this third-rate play, an ever-widening, seemingly unlimited inquiry into everything and anything that could possibly justify more authority, taxpayer dollars, distraction, time and the civil disruption. After all, that is what baseless inquisitions always do. This recommendation may save the nation from more mutual recrimination and civil unrest. Clearly, Mueller wants to build a case for impeachment, despite every indication that there is no evidence to support the cause. He wants to compel an incriminating presidential deposition, trap President Trump into a contradiction to warrant obstruction of justice charges, and use that as a pretext to help partisan Democrats in Congress lead a fight to impeach the president. It seems that Mueller wants to turn his team into heroes of the left â€“ like Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame â€“ by bringing down a Republican president. Who knows, maybe Mueller envisions an aging Robert Redford (who played Woodward in the film â€œAll the Presidentâ€™s Menâ€ in 1976) coming out of his recently-announced retirement to play him on the silver screen. Itâ€™s time to bring this drama â€“ or perhaps we should call it a farce â€“ to a close. To end this inquiry, President Trump may need to step up, and not on Twitter. Thatâ€™s because the Mueller probe is down to a game of chicken over whether to subpoena the presidentâ€™s personal testimony â€“ a risky course both for the president and for Muellerâ€™s team. If President Trump resists an open-ended deposition and Mueller seeks one by subpoena anyway, Mueller could lose at the Supreme Court. This would probably force the winding down of the special counselâ€™s unruly inquisition, and possibly tip public sentiment toward the president. However, if Mueller gambles on the subpoena and wins, everything goes the other way. The president is forced to testify with fewer limitations, Mueller is re-empowered, public opinion tips against the president. Notably, the average American loses in both eventualities. If Mueller wins, we can expect a grueling deposition, more tricks and traps â€“ and a messy, drawn out and ultimately useless impeachment confrontation. If President Trump wins at the Supreme Court, Muellerâ€™s inquisition is dealt a blow, but with no incentive for closure or resolution, just stalemate. Muellerâ€™s resentment could rise and the inquiry could go on even longer. There is a third way. If it is to work, it needs to happen now, without delay. President Trump could offer a credible, workable compromise â€“ perhaps some sworn answers to written questions and an interview on limited topics. To wait until the subpoena is issued is a dead end. President Nixon tried that, and failed miserably. Yes, circumstances were different, but the gamble becomes a debilitating distraction â€“ and ends any chance of compromise. After U.S. District Judge John Sirica upheld the subpoena of tapes that President Nixon secretly recorded of his Oval Office conversations â€“ and the Supreme Court sided with Sirica â€“ Nixon tried to compromise. He offered transcripts, verified by a Democratic senator. That might have worked before the subpoena, but the offer came too late. Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox had won on the tapes subpoena, so Nixonâ€™s compromise was useless. Cox declined the compromise and Nixon fired him in the â€œSaturday Night Massacre.â€ The rest is history. Confronting impeachment, Nixon resigned and was also nearly indicted, until President Ford pardoned him. What is the lesson from this page out of the history books? For Mueller and President Trump: Do not put our nation through any more of this inquisition mess, even if Republicans continue to control Congress, even if the Supreme Court is likely to side with the president on personal testimony, even if both sides think they could win. This increasingly baseless, meandering, delegitimized inquisition is not only distracting, discouraging and a dangerous drag on democracy â€“ exactly what Russia, China and Iran want â€“ but it does no one any good. Letâ€™s find a way to end it, consistent with rule of law. To get to that end state, President Trump may need to compromise and so will Mueller. That outcome would be best for America. This is not medieval Spain circa 1478, but modern America 2018.

          Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, left, speaks with the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II in Greensboro, N.C.
           (AP) GREENSBORO, N.C.  â€“  The Trump administration has made some dangerous changes to environmental policy, but the damage so far has been less than it initially appeared, former Vice President Al Gore said in an interview Monday. â€œHe (President Trump) has had less of an impact so far than I feared that he would. Someone said last year his administration is a blend of malevolence and incompetence,â€ Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press in Greensboro. â€œI think theyâ€™ve made some mistakes in some of the moves theyâ€™ve made. The courts have blocked some of what they wanted to do as a result.â€ Even the Republican-controlled Congress has stepped in at times, he said. â€œThe U.S. system has a lot of inherent resilience,â€ Gore said. â€œItâ€™s hard for one person, even the president, to change things very quickly if the majority of American people donâ€™t want them changed.â€ Gore was in North Carolina on Sunday and Monday to speak on behalf of the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign, which names â€œecological devastationâ€ as one of the problems hurting poor people. Gore shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his campaign to protect the environment. Video He authored a 1992 book on the climate,  â€œEarth in the Balance,â€  just before he became vice president. His work also includes the 2006 documentary  â€œAn Inconvenient Truth.â€  More recently he foundedÂ  The Climate Reality Project Â . Historians say a 1982 campaign against a PCB landfill in North Carolinaâ€™s majority-black Warren County helped give birth to the environmental justice movement so itâ€™s especially appropriate that the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign has its roots in the state, Gore said. The campaignâ€™s co-chair is the Rev. William Barber, who founded the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina and has served as president of the state NAACP chapter. Low-income communities typically suffer the brunt of environmental damage because they lack the â€œeconomic and political clout necessary to make their case and defend themselvesâ€ so theyâ€™re more likely to become locations of â€œthese pollution streams and waste sites,â€ Gore said. He said current dangers include the loosening of regulations for dumps for coal ash, which contains toxic metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic.  The new acting secretary of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, was quick to ease rules for handling the toxic ash from more than 400 U.S. coal-fired power plants. Coal ash is a particular issue in North Carolina, where a major leak from a Duke Energy site in 2014 left coal ash coating 70 miles of the Dan River on the North Carolina-Virginia border.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gore-says-trump-had-less-of-an-environmental-impact-so-far-than-previously-feared,REGULATION,Fox News,

NEW YORK â€“  Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman declared Tuesday that she ""will not be silenced"" by President Donald Trump, remaining defiant as her public feud with her former boss appeared set to shift from the court of public opinion to a possible battle in a court of law. In an interview with The Associated Press, Manigault Newman, who is promoting her new book about her time in Trump&aposs orbit, said she believes the president&aposs campaign organization is trying to keep her from telling her story.

Still, the former reality TV star-turned-political aide declined to answer several questions about her experiences during her year as the highest-ranking African-American aide in Trump&aposs White House, citing the arbitration action. She also declined to discuss details of her interview with special counsel Robert Mueller&aposs office, which she confirmed in a separate interview Tuesday. Video But Manigault Newman continued to unleash scathing criticism of Trump, saying he&aposs unfit to be president.

Discussing the differences between their views, she said: ""One, I want to see this nation united as opposed to divided. I don&apost want to see a race war as Donald Trump does."" Manigault Newman, who has known Trump since she was a contestant in 2003 on his reality TV show, ""The Apprentice,"" said the president&aposs proclivity for racial division is evident ""when you see at every single opportunity he insults African-Americans."" She noted, as examples, Trump&aposs recent criticism of NBA player LeBron James and California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.

President Trump blasted Omarosa Manigault-Newman as a â€œcrazed, crying lowlifeâ€ on Tuesday morning and went so far as to call her a ""dog,"" rapidly escalating the already heated battle between the president and the reality TV star who made her name on his show. â€œWhen you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didnâ€™t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!â€ Trump tweeted. The presidentâ€™s harsh words for â€œWackyâ€ Manigault-Newman, as he referred to her on Monday, come as the former White House aide and â€œApprenticeâ€ starâ€™s book is released. Manigault-Newmanâ€™s media blitz to promote her book, â€œUnhinged: An Insiderâ€™s Account of the Trump White House,â€ has drawn tough criticism from the White House, as she revealed she had secretly recorded Chief of Staff John Kelly as he fired her in the Situation Room. Over the weekend, Manigault-Newman released the recording of Kelly notifying her of her firing. Manigault-Newman said Sunday that Kelly was â€œthreateningâ€ her in the White House. In the recording, Kelly seeks Manigault-Newmanâ€™s â€œfriendly departureâ€ from the administration without any â€œdifficulty in the future relative to your reputation.â€ According to the tape, Kelly says things could get â€œuglyâ€ for her, and that she would be â€œopen to some legal actionâ€ for conduct that would merit a court martial if she were in the military. She later released a tape of a phone call with Trump himself. OMAROSAâ€™S REVENGE: BOOK TRASHES â€˜MOBLIKEâ€™ TRUMP, EXPOSES FAMILY DRAMA, BASHES EX-COLLEAGUES In her book, her firing is a key section. In it, she goes so far as to claim that Kelly and the White House lawyers present, upon notifying her of her termination, were holding her against her will in the Situation Room, suggesting she was at risk of an asthma attack because she initially couldn&apost get her inhaler. â€œI am an asthma sufferer, and I began to feel a tightness in my chest. I had to calm myself down or I could have had a full-blown asthma attack,â€ Manigault-Newman writes in the prologue. â€œI asked if I could go get my purse where I had stashed my inhaler, and they wouldnâ€™t let me leave the room. I asked why I was not allowed to leave, and they said this is how Kelly had set up the meeting.â€ Manigault-Newmanâ€™s assistant was ultimately allowed to â€œgo get [her] purseâ€ with the inhaler. Manigault-Newman also writes in the book that she believed her firing was related to her knowledge of a tape made in the early 2000s, in which Trump supposedly uses â€œthe N-word.â€ Trump strongly disputes the claims of such a tape. White House officials, meanwhile, blasted her for making recordings of Trump and Kelly. â€œThe thought of doing something like that to a fellow employee, not to mention the leader of the free world, is completely disgraceful,â€ Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told ""Fox & Friends."" TRUMP BLASTS â€˜WACKY OMAROSAâ€™ AFTER LEAKED TAPE: â€˜VICIOUS BUT NOT SMARTâ€™ And Trumpâ€™s personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said Monday that Manigault-Newman violated national security rules by taping White House officials inside the West Wing without their consentâ€”especially in the highly secure Situation Room. And on Monday, Trump tweeted that, â€œPeople in the White House hated her.

Dan Malloy. The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.Â New England, long a liberal stronghold, has been home to something of a Republican insurgence in recent years, with GOP candidates attributing their success to a healthy mixture of fiscal conservatism, socially moderate views and a willingness to collaborate with political rivals. Meanwhile, in Vermont, Republican Gov. Phil Scott is running for re-election â€“ and is favored to win it. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962, but Democrats have two candidates running who could make history, and some Republicans remain upset about Scott&aposs decision to sign gun-control legislation into law earlier this year. Christine Hallquist is vying to be the first openly transgender woman to serve as a U.S. governor.Â Another Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Vermont is hoping to make history as well: Ethan Sonneborn,Â a 14-year-old boy who took advantage of the state constitution&aposs lack of an age requirement to hold office.

Â Giuliani, who spoke exclusively with FOXÂ Newsâ€™ Sean Hannity, called Brennan the ""quarterback"" who took the unverified dossier from ex-British spy Christopher Steele and passed it along to then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.Â â€œUnless heâ€™s the biggest idiot intelligence agent that ever existedâ€”although he never really did much intelligence workâ€”itâ€™s false. You could look at it [the dossier] and laugh at it,â€ Giuliani said. The former New York City mayor also said special prosecutor Robert Mueller is a â€œpuppet.â€Â The precise origins of the Russia probe remain unclear. Officials have previously pointed to comments Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly made about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton as touching off the investigation in July 2016.

""It has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.""Â He attached an image of a statement from his attorneys that criticized his firing, saying ""the FBI and the American people deserve better."" Strzok, Page and the FBI texting scandal  explained &aposTROUBLING FACTS&apos ... BUT NO THREAT:Â The children discovered at an â€œextremist Muslimâ€ compound in New Mexico earlier this month  were both trained to use firearms and taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers , law enforcement and other institutions they found corrupt, state prosecutors revealed on Monday ... Â The prosecutors provided more details about the accusations during a court hearing in which they asked that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and four other defendants be held pending trial on child abuse charges.Â But Judge Sarah BackusÂ ruled against prosecutorsâ€™ request, saying thatÂ  although she was concerned by ""troubling facts,"" prosecutors failed to articulate any specific threats to the community.Â She set a $20,000 bond for each defendant and ordered that they wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their attorneys. It was also announced Monday that 3-year-old Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, who had been missing since December, allegedly died amid a ritualistic religious ceremony intended to â€œcast out demonic spirits,â€ Reuters reported. 'Extremist' ringleader of New Mexico compound  previously tested positive for explosives, ex-cop says &aposTHE GOVERNMENT RESTS&apos:Â  Prosecutors on Monday rested their case against Paul Manafort , the former Trump campaign chairman accused of bank and tax fraud in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team ... Â After a day of testimony from a bank executive, prosecutors announced in court: â€œThe government rests.â€Â Manafort, 69, is facing tax evasion and bank fraud charges after being accused of hiding a â€œsignificant percentageâ€ of income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. Heâ€™s also been accused of fraudulently obtaining millions more in bank loans, including while he was working on the Trump campaign. Itâ€™s unclear whether the defense will put forward witnesses or evidence or if the trial will head toward closing arguments. Last week, Judge T.S. Ellis IIIÂ said he was limiting closing arguments to two hours for each side.Â Ellis is also expected to rule on several of motions Tuesday morning.

14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Brooke Singman,"Omarosa's Trump tape story unravels, as more officials challenge 'N-word' claim","close Video Omarosa and Trump feud: What to know A look at the growing feud between President Donald Trump and former White House Aide Omarosa Omarosa Manigault Newmanâ€™s claims about a recording of President Trump using the â€œN-wordâ€ are being disputed by an ever-growing list of current and former officials, calling into question a key passage in her newly released political tell-all. Manigault Newmanâ€™s claims first surfaced this week in a media blitz to promote the book, â€œUnhinged: An Insiderâ€™s Account of the Trump White House,â€ which hit the shelves Tuesday. In interviews and the book, she claimed she confirmed rumors of an old tape from â€œThe Apprenticeâ€ in which Trump used the racial slur. It is unclear at this point whether Manigault Newman ever heard the alleged tapeâ€”and whether it exists. But multiple former and current officials close to the president have denied her claims. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Fox News he â€œnever heard of any tape.â€ â€œI have never heard the president use that word ever,â€ Lewandowski said Tuesday, adding that there was â€œnever a conversationâ€ about a tape and that it was â€œnever brought to [his] attention.â€ â€œThis is now a pattern of individuals who have worked inside the building who are trying to profiteer off of their relationship with the president,â€ Lewandowski said. â€œItâ€™s too bad, itâ€™s shameful and our country, and the president, deserve better.â€ Video Michael Short, a former White House aide, also told Fox News he had no knowledge of the tape. â€œI never heard the president use any of the epithets alleged in the book or epithets of any kind,â€ Short told Fox News. Manigault Newman suggested the reason Chief of Staff John Kelly fired her from her White House post was her pursuit of the tape. She wrote in her book that former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks told Kelly that Manigault Newman was â€œthis closeâ€ to getting her â€œhandsâ€ on the tape. â€œGiven the circumstances and the timing, I had to believe that the purpose was to prevent me from getting the N-word tape, which, by logic, I was now convinced had to be real,â€ she wrote in the prologue. But the former â€œApprenticeâ€ star has given varying accounts about the tape. In the book, she claimed she never heard the tape, but during interviews this week, she claimed she heard the recording after the book was written. Lynne Patton, a former assistant to Eric Trump and now a Department of Housing and Urban Development official, pushed back on Manigault Newman&aposs claims. In a statement , Patton said she got a call from her on the day she was fired, â€œinforming me that she had personally heard a second-hand recording of President Trump using the â€˜N-wordâ€™ in a derogatory fashion.â€ In that call, she said, Manigault Newman claimed she voluntarily â€œsubmitted her resignationâ€ to Kelly andÂ  recommended that Patton â€œshould promptly do the same before the audio surfaced.â€ Manigault Newman claimed this week that the original source of the alleged tape was former â€œApprenticeâ€ producer Bill Pruitt. But Patton said she spoke to Pruitt, and he has â€œNEVER had an audio tapeâ€ of Trump using the slur. Pruitt did not immediately respond to Fox Newsâ€™ request for comment. Katrina Pierson, former campaign spokeswoman, also told ""Fox News @ Night"" that she has ""no sources with that tape."" Pierson also denied ever having a conversation about the tape, adding that â€œthe reason Omarosa is facing a wrath of contradiction is because she canâ€™t keep her lies straight.â€ Patton, too, denied being on a conference call with Manigault Newman discussing the tape rumors -- as she claimed in her book. However, the emergence of yet another recording on Tuesday challenged that part of their claims. Manigault Newman released to  CBS News Â a supposed recording of that phone call. It purportedly features her, Patton, Pierson and campaign communications director Jason Miller. ""I am trying to find at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure out a way to spin it,"" Pierson says on the tape. Patton is then heard describing a conversation she had with Trump about his alleged use of the slur. ""I said, &aposWell, sir, can you think of anytime where this happened?&apos And he said, &aposno,&apos"" Patton is heard saying. Manigault Newman responds: ""Well, that is not true."" Video Pierson later says: ""No, he said it. He is embarrassed by it."" Upon the release of the CBS tape, Pierson attempted to clarify her comments. â€œI never organized a conference call with Jason Miller to confirm Mr. Trump said anything. That discussion was nothing other than sifting through unconfirmed rumors regarding â€˜The Apprenticeâ€™ tape and the transcript supports my statement,â€ Pierson said in a statement to Fox News Tuesday. â€œOmarosa fabricated the story by conflating numerous discussions.â€ Also in the book, Manigault Newman claimed that pollster Frank Luntz had directly heard the â€œN-wordâ€ tape. Luntz fired back on Friday, tweeting that her claim was â€œflat-out false.â€ â€œIâ€™m in  @Omarosa â€™s book on page 149. She claims to have heard from someone who heard from me that I heard Trump use the N-word. Not only is this flat-out false (Iâ€™ve never heard such a thing), but Omarosa didnâ€™t even make an effort to call or email me to verify. Very shoddy work,â€ Luntz tweeted. Trump on Monday night also tweeted that executive producer of â€œThe Apprenticeâ€ Mark Burnett assured him there are â€œNO TAPESâ€ where he used â€œsuch a terrible and disgusting word.â€ â€œ @MarkBurnettTV  called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa. I donâ€™t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have. She made it up,â€ Trump tweeted.

14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Brian Flood,ESPN ripped when anti-Trump broadcaster Keith Olbermann calls Mets-Yankees game,"
          ESPNâ€™s Keith Olbermann took heat on social media for calling Monday Night Baseball.
           (Â© NBC Universal, Inc.) ESPN put Keith Olbermann in the broadcast booth for Monday nightâ€™s nationally televised Subway Series game between the Yankees and Mets and the anti-Trump personality wasnâ€™t exactly appreciated by baseball fans on social media. Olbermann doesnâ€™t typically call baseball games on television, but he replaced Karl Ravech for Mondayâ€™s game â€“ which was a makeup for a July 22 rainout between the New York City rivals. The game was not available on the Yankees and Mets local networks and aired exclusively on ESPN. Itâ€™s unclear if fans disapproved of Olbermann for his far-left political views or if they simply didnâ€™t care for his broadcasting style, but his name quickly began trending and the results werenâ€™t pretty. New York Daily News columnist Bob Raissman  wrote , â€œESPN finds a way to punish Mets/Yankees fans by putting Olbermann in the TV booth tonight.â€ One user  added , â€œI think it&aposs safe to say this experiment of Keith Olbermann calling MLB games has become a disaster.â€ New York Post media columnist Andrew Marchand  sent a series of tweets  bashing the decision to put Olbermann in the booth. â€œOlbermann sounds like a guy who hasn&apost done a lot of play-by-play, which he hasn&apost. It is a bit distracting,â€ Marchand  wrote . â€œPutting Olbermann in the booth was a bad decision. This game doesn&apost need a gimmick.â€ Marchand  added : â€œIt also is not a good decision internally. How many more loyal to ESPN play-by-players than Olbermann would kill for the opportunity to do Yanks-Mets? Reward them.â€ â€œESPN allowing Keith Olbermann to announce this baseball game is the worst thing to ever happen to the sport,â€ Barstool Sportsâ€™ Eric Hubbs  wrote . Sports blog Razzball  tweeted , â€œThat ESPN thinks Keith Olbermann is a good idea tells you everything you need to know about ESPN.â€ One fan  cautioned ESPN about what was occurring on social media  during the 8-5 Metsâ€™ victory: â€œHey  @ESPN , do a quick twitter search of â€˜Keith Olbermannâ€™ and maybe think twice next time you want him to call a game.â€ Not everyone hated Olbermannâ€™s performance. TVNewser editor  A.J. Katz chimed in , admitting that he had an â€œunpopular opinionâ€ and enjoyed the former MSNBC star calling the game.  ESPN announced in May that Olbermann will frequently guest anchor the flagship â€œSportsCenter,â€ serve as an MLB play-by-play broadcaster, co-host various opinion programs such as â€œPardon the Interruptionâ€ and guest host ESPN Audio programs. It marked Olbermannâ€™s sixth stint at ESPN and the time in-between has been largely spent as a far-left political pundit on MSNBC and an assortment of other networks. Most recently, he anchored an anti-Trump online program for GQ, â€œThe Resistance,â€ and authored a book titled, â€œTrump is F*cking Crazy: (This is Not a Joke).â€ Olbermann has been among the most outspoken critics of the president in the entire media industry, even moving out of his luxury New York City apartment building because it was owned by Trump. He once claimed that Trump and his family have done more damage to the U.S. than 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden. In August 2017, OlbermannÂ  tweeted at first daughter Ivanka Trump Â and called her father a â€œneo-Nazi,â€ and â€œracist.â€Â Olbermann frequently used profanity to criticize President Trump, often referring to him as a â€œracist f---,â€ but ESPNâ€™s star doesnâ€™t bother to use the sanitized version of the cuss word. Olbermann has managed to avoid tweeting about Trump since ESPN announced he would return to the network.Â During Mondayâ€™s game, Twitter was filled with an onslaught of other anti-Olbermann messages, ranging from humorous to angry. ESPN declined comment when reached by Fox News.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/espn-ripped-when-anti-trump-broadcaster-keith-olbermann-calls-mets-yankees-game,Media,Fox News,
14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Brooke Singman,"Trump campaign files complaint against Omarosa, says she breached confidentiality agreement","close Video Trump campaign takes legal action against Omarosa Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman accused of violating confidentiality agreement; Laura Ingle reports from New York. The Trump campaign has filed a formal complaint against Omarosa Manigault Newman saying she breached a confidentiality agreement signed in 2016, in response to her newly released book and promotional tour. â€œDonald J. Trump for President, Inc. has filed an arbitration against Omarosa Manigault Newman, with the American Arbitration Association in New York City, for breach of her 2016 confidentiality agreement with the Trump Campaign,â€ a Trump campaign official told Fox News in a statement on Tuesday. The move comes as the reality TV star&aposs explosive tell-all memoir is released, detailing her time at the White House and with the 2016 campaign. In the book and in promotional interviews, she has trashed her former colleagues and President Trump himself. But the question of whether she violated any confidentiality agreement has hung over the tour. In her book, she claimed that she â€œrefusedâ€ to sign a non-disclosure agreement upon her exit from the Trump White House. But on Monday, Trump tweeted that â€œWacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!â€ This may have been a reference to one signed when joining the campaign. TheÂ  Washington Examiner Â reportedly obtained a sample of the agreement, which would require her to keep information about the president, his companies and his family confidential, and not â€œdisparageâ€ the Trump family â€œduring the term of your service and at all times thereafter.â€ It&aposs unclear whether such an agreement would apply to disclosures about events and conversations after the campaign, however. The American Arbitration Association declined to comment when asked by Fox News about the complaint. In her book, â€œUnhinged: An Insiderâ€™s Account of the Trump White House,â€ released Tuesday, Manigault Newman aims to settle countless scores, blasting Trump, depicting tensions inside the first family and mocking her former campaign and White House colleagues. Manigault-Newman also accuses Trump in the book of being â€œracistâ€ and a â€œmisogynist,â€ and of being â€œmentally and physically impaired.â€ Manigault Newman accuses Trump, whom she calls her â€œmentorâ€ throughout the book, of expecting â€œmoblikeâ€ loyalty, likening him to a â€œcult leader.â€ â€œLoyalty is a loaded topic when it comes to Donald Trump. His moblike loyalty requirements are exacting, imperishable, and sometimes unethical (as in James Comeyâ€™s case.),â€ she writes. â€œBut for the people in Trumpworld, loyalty to him is an absolute and unyielding necessity, akin to followersâ€™ devotion to a cult leader.â€ She alleges: â€œTrumpworld is a cult of personality focused solely on Donald J. Trump.â€ Trump has blasted Manigault Newman, calling her â€œwackyâ€ and a â€œcrazed, crying lowlife.â€ And on Tuesday, Trump praised his chief of staff John Kelly for â€œfiring that dog!â€ The president also blasted her as â€œvicious, but not smartâ€ and said â€œpeople in the White House hated her.â€ She has drawn tough criticism from the White House after she revealed secretly taped recordings of her conversation with Kelly in the White House Situation Room during her termination, and said that Kelly was â€œthreateningâ€ her. She also revealed she taped a phone conversation with Trump after she was fired. Manigault Newman, meanwhile, claimed that she believed her firing was related to her knowledge of a tape made in the early 2000s, in which Trump supposedly uses â€œthe N-word.â€ Trump and current and former White House and campaign officials dispute the claims of such a tape.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-files-complaint-against-omarosa-says-she-breached-confidentiality-agreement,White House,Fox News,
14/08/2018,2018,8,14,Alex Pappas,"Defense rests in Manafort case, ex-Trump campaign chairman won't testify","close Video Manafort jury prepares to hear closing arguments  Defense rests case without calling any witnesses; Catherine Herridge reports on the court proceedings. The defense for Paul Manafort rested their case Tuesday without calling the ex-Trump campaign chairman to the stand to testify in the bank and tax fraud case against him. Addressing the court for the first time during his trial, Manafort stood up and told Judge T.S. Ellis III that he did not want to testify. After two weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses, until now it had been unclear whether the defense would put forward witnesses or evidence of their own. Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team rested their case Monday afternoon. â€œWe believe the government has failed to meet their burden of proof and weâ€™ve rested on that,â€ Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing told reporters outside court. Video The trial now heads to closing arguments, set to begin Wednesday morning. Ellis told both sides to limit those arguments to one and a half hours each. PROSECUTION RESTS CASE IN MANAFORT CASE Manafort, 69, is facing tax evasion and bank fraud charges after being accused of hiding income earned from his Ukrainian work from the IRS. Heâ€™s also accused of fraudulently obtaining millions in bank loans. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Ellis on Tuesday also ruled against the defenseâ€™s motion to acquit. The trial was delayed for two hours Tuesday after the morning proceedings began under seal and were closed to the public and press.  Before the trial adjourned for the day, the court took part in whatâ€™s called a charging conference - where the judge and lawyers from both sides discussed what the judge would tell the jury before deliberations. Ellis, who has not shied from making colorful comments during the trial, signaled that he will tell the jury to disregard any comments he made during witness testimony that might have shown his opinion. â€œDo you think I made any comments,â€ Ellis asked both sides. After a short silence, prosecutor Greg Andres stood and said, â€œYes.â€ There was audible laughter in the courtroom. Last week, the prosecutionâ€™s star witness, Rick Gates â€“ Manafortâ€™s former business partner who struck a plea deal to cooperate with the government -- testified that he and Manafort committed bank and tax fraud together. On Monday, James Brennan, the vice president of The Federal Savings Bank, testified under immunity about a loan the bank gave Manafort. According to Brennan, the bank approved $16 million in loans to Manafort by CEO Stephen Calk, who was angling for a cabinet position in the Trump administration. When asked by prosecutor Greg Andres if he thought the loan should have been approved, Brennan replied, â€œMy recommendation was the loan not be made.â€ Brennan said the loan was approved because of Calk. He said the Federal Savings Bank ended up losing $11.8 million on the loan. The prosecution had been expected to rest on Friday. But Ellis mysteriously delayed testimony in the case for five hours on Friday. The postponement was significant, as prosecutors had been hoping to finish calling witnesses Friday -- and Ellis has a reputation as a stickler for keeping trials moving. Manafortâ€™s legal troubles wonâ€™t end with this trial. He is also facing charges in a separate federal court case in Washington, including conspiring against the United States, conspiring to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal and providing false statements.

07/08/2018,2018,8,7,Gregory T. Angelo,It's wrong to call Kavanaugh anti-LGBT - Trump's Supreme Court nominee deserves a hearing,"close Video Who is Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's SCOTUS pick? President Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Here's a look at Trump's nominee. The nationâ€™s largest LGBT organization, the Human Rights Campaign, has unsurprisingly come out swinging in opposition to Senate confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trumpâ€™s nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. The group is using a specious cherry-picked  â€œreportâ€  as the backbone of its opposition to Kavanaugh, who currently serves as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The HRC disapproval of Kavanaugh should raise precisely zero eyebrows. Following the 2016 elections, the organization has all but become an official wing of the Democratic Party and the tedious â€œResistance.â€ What is astonishing is that in the dozen pages issued by the HRC painting Kavanaugh as an enemy of the LGBT community, there is not a single mention of anything he has done, said, or written that could be even remotely construed as anti-LGBT. In fact, there are a number of reasons LGBT Americans should take heart in Kavanaughâ€™s nomination and his likely confirmation as the next associate justice of nationâ€™s highest court. In 2003, while on the staff of President George W. Bush, Kavanaugh met with a group of over 200 gay men as part of a Log Cabin Republicans event at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building â€“ hardly the mark of a raging homophobe jurist. As a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy â€“ whose recent retirement created a vacancy Kavanaugh has been nominated to fill â€“ Kavanaugh served the most quantifiably pro-gay Supreme Court justice in the history of the United States. No one authored more pro-gay opinions â€“ with more far-reaching consequences â€“ than Kennedy. The concurrence of another former Kennedy clerk, Justice Neil Gorsuch, in the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision this year affirmed that  â€œour society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.â€ That could well lead one to conclude that Kennedyâ€™s sympathy to the challenges of LGBT Americans was imparted to his clerks. In the very pages of the HRC critique of Kavanaughâ€™s record is a remarkable admission: â€œDuring his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit, he did not substantively address any of the Supreme Courtâ€™s seminal LGBTQ decisions.â€ In the absence of anything substantive or explicit to condemn, as  Buzzfeed notes , the report instead zeroes in on â€œconcerns about Kavanaughâ€™s views on the Affordable Care Act, voter ID laws, and federal agency power, as well as his rulings in employment discrimination cases.â€ The rollout of the HRC Kavanaugh file includes an assertion that  â€œa thorough review of Kavanaughâ€™s record on LGBTQ issues, during his time at the White House in particular, will be crucial to the nomination process.â€ On this point I agree. But the very title of the report â€“ â€œBrett M. Kavanaugh: Wrong for LGBTQ People. Wrong for the Supreme Courtâ€ â€“ shows that the findings of this â€œanalysisâ€ were  fait accompli  before a single file from the Kavanaugh archives was cracked. None of this is surprising. The motley assemblage in front of the Supreme Court on the night Kavanaugh was nominated was a  mad-libs protest  confirming that anyone nominated by President Trump would be unacceptable to the left â€“ LGBT or otherwise. The HRC report on Kavanaugh is simply a reverse engineering of the conclusion that LGBT Democrats came to the moment Kennedy announced his retirement in June. To be sure, serious questions remain regarding Kavanaughâ€™s perspective on LGBT legal issues currently percolating through the federal courts, but sussing out those answers is the purpose of Senate confirmation hearings. Opposing a Kavanaugh confirmation before even hearing out the nominee is an affront to our countryâ€™s sacred democratic process and the deference a judge with an undeniably accomplished career deserves. Brett Kavanaugh deserves a full hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The LGBT community owes him an open mind.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-wrong-to-call-kavanaugh-anti-lgbt-trumps-supreme-court-nominee-deserves-a-hearing,OPINION,Fox News,
01/08/2018,2018,8,1,OpsLens.com,"Citing Democratic Donations, Trump Says Sessions Should End Mueller Investigation","
 (Woch-It) President Donald Trump urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the special investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Justifying his request, President Trump cited donations made by some of Robert Muellerâ€™s team to Hillary Clinton and other democrats. Taking to Twitter, President Trump tweeted: So who are the 17 angry Democrats? That would seem to be Muellerâ€™s investigative team. Mueller himself is a life- long Republican who previously served under George W. Bush. It appears, however, that 3 members of Muellerâ€™s team of investigators have donated $56,000 to Democratic candidates, two of whom donated the maximum $2,700 personal donations to Trumpâ€™s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Mueller investigation is examining more than Russian interference. Many of those close to President Trump have come under investigation for alleged collusion, and some have been charged. Some believe that President Trump himself could come under direct scrutiny, and possibly even be charged. Trump has thus far denied all allegations and speculation that he colluded with Russia. So far, the Justice Department has yet to respond to President Trumpâ€™s Twitter request. Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the investigation. However, that seems to be more of a formality and personal pledge than anything legally binding. Sessions has found himself under intense pressure from President Trump, despite the fact that he was among the Presidentâ€™s staunchest early supporters. Itâ€™s fair to wonder if heâ€™ll cave to pressure. As for me, I have always believed that the Mueller investigation should be concluded. However, it does seem to be inappropriate to include the two people who donated to Hillary Clinton on the team. Disclosures should have been used, and those who donated to Clinton should have been excluded. This is a shocking bit of incompetence. While I believe Mueller should remain, the two Clinton-donating investigators should be excluded.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/citing-democratic-donations-trump-says-sessions-should-end-mueller-investigation,US,Fox News,

Congress has yet to fund the wall, and Trumpâ€™s demands that Mexico pay for it have gone nowhere. However, the president  has seemingly evolved  on what heâ€™s called the â€œbig, beautiful wall,â€ as he has contended a physical structure might not be needed â€œwhere you have rivers and mountains and everything else protectingâ€ the border.

It was then that he made the controversial remarks about the people emigrating from Mexico. â€œWhen Mexico sends its people, theyâ€™re not sending their best,â€ Trump said on June 16, 2015. â€œTheyâ€™re sending people that have lots of problems â€¦ Theyâ€™re bringing drugs. Theyâ€™re bringing crime. Theyâ€™re rapists.â€ â€œI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me,â€ Trump said. â€œIâ€™ll build a great, great wall on our southern border, and Iâ€™ll have Mexico pay for that wall.
